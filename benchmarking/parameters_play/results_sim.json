Reduced study time: By accrediting your prior learning, you may be able to reduce the amount of time you need to spend studying for a particular module or course. This is because you will already have acquired the necessary knowledge and skills through your previous experiences.\n2. Streamlined curriculum: APL can help you bypass certain modules or courses that you've already covered in your prior learning, allowing you to focus on more advanced or specialized topics.\n3. Enhanced academic profile: Having your prior learning accredited can enhance your academic profile by demonstrating your ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations and showcasing your skills and expertise.\n4. Increased flexibility: APL can provide greater flexibility in your studies, as you may be able to take on additional modules or courses that align with your interests and career goals.\n5.
