[{"response": "Subject: Re: Questions regarding MSc Software Engineering Application\n\nDear Mr. Doe,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am David Frischer, the program administrator for the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London.\n\nThank you for your interest in our program and for reaching out with your questions. I'd be happy to assist you.\n\nRegarding your first question, the English language requirements for our MSc Software Engineering program are stated on our prospectus page. You may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency, or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test. Our English language policy details all of the ways in which you can meet the minimum English language requirement for your chosen programme of study.\n\nAs for your second question, if your request for accreditation of prior learning is approved, it will not affect your program duration and course load. The recognition of prior learning (RPL) will be considered alongside your application, and if approved, it will be reflected in your offer letter. Please note that all RPL requests are considered at UCL's discretion.\n\nI hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDavid Frischer", "sources": [{"id": "44d49fcb-68ab-4280-923a-1a9135654f76", "url": "file://www_ucl.ac.uk-prospective-studentsgraduatefrequently-asked-questions.html", "title": "www_ucl.ac.uk-prospective-studentsgraduatefrequently-asked-questions.html", "docAuthor": "no author found", "description": "No description found.", "docSource": "URL link uploaded by the user.", "chunkSource": "link://https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/frequently-asked-questions", "published": "8/6/2024, 3:34:52 PM", "wordCount": 3929, "token_count_estimate": 4952, "text": "<document_metadata>\nsourceDocument: www_ucl.ac.uk-prospective-studentsgraduatefrequently-asked-questions.html\npublished: 8/6/2024, 3:34:52 PM\n</document_metadata>\n\nWe advise that you contact the academic department before submitting your application to identify a supervisor who will be available to supervise your research.\n\nMy university will only provide my transcript directly to UCL.
