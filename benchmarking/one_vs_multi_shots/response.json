  "generated_draft_email": "Subject: Re: Application Questions for MSc in Software Engineering at UCL\n\nDear John,\n\nThank you for your email and for considering the MSc in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify some essential details before submitting your application.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n1. English Language Proficiency Test:\nAccording to UCL's website, you may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency, or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test (such as IELTS or TOEFL). It is recommended that you check the programme's prospectus page for the specific English language requirements. If you do not provide evidence of English language proficiency with your application, admission will be conditional upon providing such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.\n\n2. Part-time Work:\nRegarding part-time work during studies, I couldn't find a specific answer in our contexts. However, I suggest checking UCL's student visa webpages or contacting them directly for information on working part-time as an international student. They will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n\n3. Application Fee:\nAccording to our guidelines, yes, you do need to pay an application processing fee for most graduate taught programmes at UCL. However, there may be some exceptions. For full details on Application fees, please refer to our website or contact us directly.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I'm more than happy to assist you in the application process.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDavid\nProgram Administrator for MSc Software Engineering at UCL"
