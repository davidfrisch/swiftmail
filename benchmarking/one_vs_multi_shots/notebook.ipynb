      "[\"Question: When can I expect to receive a decision on my fee status?\\nAnswer: Hello Lewis!\\n\\nThank you for reaching out to us with your query. As an international student applying for the BSc in Computer Science program at University College London (UCL), we're happy to help you with any questions or concerns.\\n\\nRegarding your question about when you can expect to receive a decision on your fee status, we aim to provide you with the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this if additional information is required from you to inform our decision.\\n\\nIf further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete. We appreciate that waiting for a university decision can be an anxious time, but please be assured that we will communicate our decision to you as soon as we are able to.\\n\\nWe aim to make our decisions by the end of April, and we're working hard to send decisions sooner. Please keep in mind that it's quite usual for some applicants to hear sooner than others, but this doesn't mean that your application will be unsuccessful if you don't get a quick response from us.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help and look forward to welcoming you to UCL soon! \\n-------\\n\", \"Question: Could you please let me know the typical timeframe for receiving this information?\\nAnswer: Hello Lewis!\\n\\nThank you for reaching out to us with your query about making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission. We're happy to help.\\n\\nRegarding the timeframe for receiving a decision on your fee status, we aim to process applications as quickly as possible. After you have applied, UCL will request any missing information required to support an application, please do not send information that has not been requested. If we require any additional documents to process your application, we will contact you by email and ask you to upload them securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal).\\n\\nInformation that is required for your application is detailed on the UCAS website and in our After You Apply guide.\\n\\nPlease be assured that we will communicate our decision to you as soon as we are able to. We aim to make our decisions by the end of April, but are working hard to send decisions sooner. Please keep in mind that it's quite usual for some applicants to hear sooner than others, but this doesn't mean that your application will be unsuccessful if you don't get a quick response from us.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help and look forward to welcoming you to UCL soon! \\n-------\\n\", \"Question: If I am awarded additional A-levels or other qualifications prior to the start of term, would it be possible for me to update my application? Or is there a specific deadline by which any amendments must be made?\\nAnswer: Hello Lewis!\\n\\nThank you for reaching out to us with your query about making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission. We're happy to help.\\n\\nRegarding updating your application, UCL may not accept qualifications added to your UCAS application form after it has been submitted. And as such, they may not be accepted for meeting offer conditions. This includes qualifications submitted either as an amendment or additional qualification.\\n\\nQualifications data submitted via UCAS must reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking.\\n\\nPlease note that if you have any further information to provide, we will request this from you at a later stage in our decision-making process. If you have any concerns about providing information at that time, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help and look forward to welcoming you to UCL soon! \\n-------\\n\"]\n"
