Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for accepting your place on our programme. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and we want to support you through this process.

Regarding deadlines, the deadline for accepting an offer typically does not apply in this scenario. However, if you have already paid a tuition fee deposit, it is essential to check with our Student Fees team regarding any deadlines or penalties associated with withdrawing your application.

We would appreciate it if you could provide us with more information about the unforeseen circumstances that have led to your decision. This will enable us to better understand your situation and potentially offer support or guidance where possible.

The procedures for cancelling or withdrawing from the programme after accepting an offer are as follows:

1. Contact our Admissions Team: Reach out to us via email at [admissions@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:admissions@ucl.ac.uk) or by phone on +44 (0)20 3108 2200.

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for reaching out to us about your concerns. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and we're happy to guide you through the process if you need to cancel or withdraw from the programme.

According to our admissions policy, once a decision has been made on an application, it cannot be reconsidered. However, you are welcome to apply for the programme in subsequent years, especially when the intervening time has been spent strengthening your application. Please note that applications will be considered anew and in competition with all other applications for that particular intake.

If you have accepted our offer but are no longer able to attend, please visit our Offer Holder FAQs page for more information on what you should do next.

Regarding cancelling or withdrawing from the programme after accepting an offer, please note that UCL does not accept applications for deferred entry to taught postgraduate programmes. Applicants must apply in the admissions cycle for which they seek entry.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you throughout your application journey and beyond.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering
