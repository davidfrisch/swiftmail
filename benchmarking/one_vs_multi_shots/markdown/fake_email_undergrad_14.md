Subject: Re: Application Queries - Computer Science Undergraduate Programme

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in pursuing a degree in BSc Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I'm more than happy to help clarify any concerns you may have regarding the application process.

Regarding your first query, "Will re-taking examinations in the upcoming summer session impact my eligibility for the undergraduate programme?", based on our entry requirements, it's likely that the Undergraduate Admissions team would be able to provide further guidance on this specific scenario. As a local student living within the UK, it's unlikely that re-taking examinations would significantly impact your eligibility for the undergraduate programme. However, I would recommend contacting the Undergraduate Admissions team directly to confirm their stance.

In terms of your fee status decision, you can expect UCL to determine this in line with regulations published by the UK government. As a student living within the UK, it's likely that you will be considered for Home fees. You can expect this decision to be made before making your Firm and Insurance decisions. If further information is needed, we will email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for completion.

Regarding your third query, "How will UCL view my application in this context? Will the fact that I am taking additional subjects strengthen or weaken my chances of being considered for a place on the BSc Computer Science programme?", taking additional subjects may strengthen your chances of being considered for a place on the BSC Computer Science programme. However, it's essential to note that UCL's admission process considers various factors beyond academic qualifications, such as relevant work experience, professional experience (where required), and other skills or achievements.

I hope this information is helpful in addressing your queries. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you the best of luck with your application!

Best regards,

David

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the BSc Computer Science undergraduate programme at University College London (UCL). We're happy to help clarify any questions you may have about the application process.

Regarding your first query, re-taking examinations will not impact your eligibility for the undergraduate programme. UCL considers applications from students who have not completed their A levels or equivalent qualifications, and we welcome applications from students in this situation. Please note that if you are offered a place, your offer will be based on the three highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects.

Regarding your second query, we determine fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website. Unfortunately, we cannot comment on your fee status until we have received and assessed your application. If you receive an offer of admission to UCL and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment.

Regarding your third query, if you are studying more than three A levels, including Mathematics and Computer Science, we will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. Your additional subjects may not necessarily strengthen or weaken your chances of being considered for a place on the BSc Computer Science programme, as our admissions process is competitive and based on various factors.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're always happy to help.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering
