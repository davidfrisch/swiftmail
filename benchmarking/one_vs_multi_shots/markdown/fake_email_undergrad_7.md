Subject: Re: Queries regarding UCAS Application for Computer Science Program at UCL

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your queries regarding your UCAS application. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first query, it is not possible to add or update qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission. The information provided must accurately reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking. If there are any changes to your qualifications, please ensure that these are reflected in your IB transcript or other relevant documentation.

Regarding your second query, we will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects for our Computer Science program. If you're studying more than three A levels, your offer may be based on the three most relevant subjects for the program. Please note that UCL considers a small number of Foundation programs, and if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us directly.

Please rest assured that we will view your application holistically, taking into account all the information provided. We're confident that our admissions team will make an informed decision based on your academic achievements and other relevant factors.

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your queries regarding your UCAS application to the Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, it is not recommended to make changes to your qualifications on your UCAS application after submission. According to UCL's FAQ, any qualifications submitted via UCAS must reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking. If you're unsure or need to make any changes, I would recommend contacting UCL directly for guidance.

Please note that adding or updating information after submission might not be accepted by UCL, and it's essential to ensure that your application is accurate and complete from the start.

Moving on to your second question, if you're studying more than 3 A levels (in your case, 4), UCL will consider the 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. The additional A level being taken might not necessarily affect your chances of getting an offer.

In fact, since you're taking 4 A levels as part of your IB curriculum, UCL's admissions team may view this as a strong academic background. They may consider the additional A level in a similar way to students taking 3 A levels, focusing on the 3 highest grades that are most relevant to your chosen program.

So, don't worry about the extra A level affecting your chances of getting an offer! Just make sure you highlight your strengths and achievements in your application, and provide any necessary documentation or explanations if required.

I hope this helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help.

Best regards,

David
