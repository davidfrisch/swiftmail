Subject: Re: Queries regarding Undergraduate Application

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions regarding your undergraduate application to UCL's Computer Science program. I'm more than happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your application status, "gathered field" is an intermediate stage where our team has received all the necessary information and documents from you. We are currently reviewing your application to ensure it meets the requirements for admission. Please rest assured that this does not mean your application is stuck or pending further action; we will contact you if any additional information is required.

Regarding applying for multiple undergraduate programs at UCL, yes, it is possible! You can submit separate applications for each program you're interested in. However, please note that you'll need to meet the specific entry requirements for each program and ensure you have a strong academic record. If you decide to apply for multiple programs, we recommend submitting your applications simultaneously to avoid any delays.

Lastly, regarding transferring from another university to UCL's Computer Science program, we do consider transfers into the second year of an undergraduate programme for a limited number of programmes. To initiate a transfer, please email [admissions@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:admissions@ucl.ac.uk) with your current university details, academic record, and reasons for wanting to transfer. We'll guide you through the process and provide any necessary information regarding specific requirements or deadlines.

I hope this addresses your concerns, Lewis! If you have any further questions or require clarification on anything, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering

Subject: Re: Queries regarding Undergraduate Application

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for reaching out to us with your questions. I'm happy to help clarify the status of your application.

Firstly, regarding your 'gathered field' status, I'd like to explain that it simply means all applications are being evaluated in the same fair and consistent manner. This approach ensures that we can make an informed decision once we've received and processed all other applications. You don't need to submit any additional documents at this time. We will contact you via email if there's anything missing or if we require further information from you.

Regarding your question about applying for more than one undergraduate program at UCL, according to our policy, you can only apply for a maximum of one undergraduate program. Since you're currently studying at another university and wish to transfer to UCL's Computer Science program, I would recommend focusing on this one application. If your application is successful, we'll work with your current institution to facilitate the transfer process.

If your application is not successful or if you decide to apply to other programs, you will need to reapply through UCAS and meet our first-year entrance requirements as detailed in our prospectus.

Lastly, regarding the necessary steps to initiate a transfer, please follow these steps:

1. Check our undergraduate prospectus for the specific entry requirements and deadlines for the Computer Science program.
2. Ensure that your current university has a formal agreement with UCL regarding transfer of credits. This is essential for us to recognize your previous academic work.
3. Meet with your current university's academic advisor to discuss your plans and obtain their support for the transfer.
4. Apply through UCAS, using the Transfer application route. Make sure to select the correct program code (UCAS code) for UCL's Computer Science program.
5. Submit any required documents, such as academic transcripts and a personal statement.

Please note that the deadline for transfer applications typically falls in January, but this may vary depending on the program you're applying to. I recommend checking our website or contacting the admissions team directly for specific deadlines.

Once your application is successful, we'll work with your current institution to facilitate the transfer process. This usually involves transferring credits and ensuring a smooth transition into your new program at UCL.

If you have any further questions or concerns about the transfer process, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help.

Best regards,

UCL Admissions Team
