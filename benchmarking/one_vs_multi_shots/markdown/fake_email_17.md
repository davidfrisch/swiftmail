Subject: Re: Query regarding Graduate Programme Admissions and Visa Process

Dear John,

Thank you for expressing interest in our Master of Science (MSc) programme in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help with your query.

Regarding your concern about visa processing delays, please be assured that we understand the importance of timely entry clearance. If your student visa is delayed, it may impact your ability to start the MSc programme at UCL. However, our Admissions team will work closely with you to explore possible contingency plans and measures to accommodate students in such situations.

Please note that if you are a non-UK national requiring a student visa to study at UCL, you must obtain this before arriving in the UK. We recommend applying for your visa well in advance of your intended arrival date to ensure sufficient time for processing.

To address your concerns about handling delayed visa applications, here are some steps you can take to ensure a smooth transition into the programme:

1. **Keep us informed**: As soon as you know there's an issue with your visa application, please notify our Admissions team via email or phone call. We'll work closely with you to explore possible solutions.
2. **Understand UCL's policy**: Our Student Fee Status webpages provide details on how we assess fee status and any potential implications for students whose visas are delayed.
3. **Seek independent guidance**: The UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) offers independent guidance on student visa applications. You can also consult with our Admissions team for personalized advice.

In the event of a visa delay, we may need to adjust your programme start date or provide alternative arrangements until your visa is processed. We'll work closely with you to find a solution that minimizes any disruption to your studies.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing back from you soon!

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator for the UCL Software Engineering MSc program
