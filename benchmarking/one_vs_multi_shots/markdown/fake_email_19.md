Subject: Re: Queries regarding Graduate Admissions to MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions and concerns. I'm happy to help address them.

Regarding your first query, unfortunately, under UCL Admissions policy, reasons for an unsuccessful application are not normally provided for graduate programmes. However, the usual reasons for rejection may include factors such as academic performance, personal statement, or references.

As for appealing against the decision made on your application, I regret to inform you that applications cannot be reconsidered once a decision has been made. You are most welcome to apply for the programme in the following or subsequent years, especially when the intervening time has been spent strengthening your application. However, please note that applications will be considered anew and in competition with all other applications for that particular intake.

Moving on to your second question, if you were to receive an offer this academic year, you would typically have a few weeks to accept it before the deadline. You can then request a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) once you've accepted the offer. This document is essential for your immigration purposes and further planning.

Regarding deferral, I'm afraid that UCL will not accept applications for deferred entry to taught postgraduate programmes. Applicants must apply in the admissions cycle for which they seek entry.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in pursuing the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I am pleased to respond to your queries.

Regarding your first question, as per our Admissions policy, reasons for an unsuccessful application are not normally provided for graduate programmes. However, I can provide you with some general information on the usual reasons for rejection. These may include:

* The degree-level qualification(s) undertaken by the applicant is/are below, or projected to be below, the minimum entry requirement for the programme of study.
* The degree-level qualification(s) undertaken by the applicant is/are not in a relevant subject for the programme of study applied for.
* Entry to the programme of study is very competitive and the number of applications received exceeds the number of places available.
* There is insufficient relevant work experience to compensate for not meeting the minimum academic entry requirement.
* There is insufficient relevant professional experience (where this is required by the admitting department).

If you would like to discuss your application further, please feel free to contact the academic department directly. They may be able to provide you with further feedback.

Regarding your question about appealing against the decision made on your application, I'm afraid that under UCL Admissions policy, it is not possible to appeal against a decision. However, if you would like to request feedback on your application, please let us know and we will do our best to provide you with some general guidance.

Assuming your application does proceed with a successful outcome in any future appeals or re-evaluations, I can inform you that if your application is successful, we aim to send out Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) letters by the end of April. However, this may vary depending on the complexity of your application and our decision-making process. We will notify you as soon as possible once your CAS letter has been issued.

Lastly, regarding your question about deferring your application, yes, it is possible to defer your start date for a maximum of 12 months. If you wish to defer, please submit a written request to us at least 6 weeks prior to the original start date. Please note that deferrals are subject to availability and approval by the department.

The deadline to apply for deferral is typically around mid-June for September starters. However, this may vary depending on the programme you have applied for and our decision-making process. We will notify you as soon as possible once your request has been processed.

Please note that whilst you can change your correspondence email address, the email address used to register your account with us will remain your log in username.

Best regards,
