Subject: Re: Queries regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Application

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in studying Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We appreciate your enthusiasm and are happy to help with your queries.

Regarding your question about applying to our Computer Science program while still completing a Foundation programme, we do consider applications from students who are still in the process of completing their Foundation programme. However, please note that meeting the minimum academic entry requirements is crucial for consideration. You can find more information about our entry requirements on our website. As you mentioned, you will be completing your Foundation programme by [Expected Completion Date]. If you meet or are expected to achieve the minimum academic entry requirements, we would be happy to consider your application.

Please note that UCL only accepts applications from students who have completed their Foundation programme by the start of their undergraduate studies. Therefore, if you are accepted into our program, you will need to complete your Foundation programme and obtain the necessary qualifications before starting your undergraduate degree at UCL.

If you meet the requirements and would like to apply, please submit your application through UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) by the relevant deadline. We will review your application once we receive your results from your Foundation programme.

Regarding making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission, please note that UCL may not accept qualifications added to your UCAS application form after it has been submitted. This includes qualifications submitted either as an amendment or additional qualification. Qualifications data submitted via UCAS must reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking.

You can read more about the information required for your application on the UCAS website. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing these queries. We look forward to receiving your application and considering it for our Computer Science program.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc
