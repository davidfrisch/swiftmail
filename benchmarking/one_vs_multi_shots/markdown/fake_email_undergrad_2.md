Subject: Re: Application Questions for Computer Science Undergraduate Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for showing interest in the Computer Science undergraduate program at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify some of your questions regarding your application.

Regarding your first question, UCL views applications from students who are studying more than three A levels by considering their 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. In your case, since you're taking four A-levels (Maths, Physics, Computer Science, and Further Mathematics), UCL will consider your top 3 grades: Maths, Computer Science, and either Physics or Further Mathematics. The specific combination of these three subjects may influence the offer you receive for the Computer Science program.

It's always best to check with the Admissions team directly for personalized guidance on how your application will be viewed. I'm happy to provide more information if needed.

Moving on to your second question, it is possible to apply for multiple undergraduate programs within UCL. Since you're applying as an undergraduate student, there isn't a specific limit on the number of programs you can apply to. However, it's always best to check with the Admissions team directly for personalized guidance on how your application will be viewed and what programs are available for consideration.

If you're interested in exploring other related programs, I recommend contacting the Undergraduate Admissions office (as mentioned at the beginning of our FAQs) or reaching out to the departments you're interested in applying to. They can provide you with more information on their application processes and help you determine which programs are a good fit for your interests and qualifications.

Finally, regarding procedures and deadlines for applying to multiple undergraduate programs at UCL, I recommend contacting the Undergraduate Admissions office directly via phone (+44 (0)20 8059 0939) or through their applicant portal, Portico. They'll be able to provide you with more information on how your application will be viewed and what programs are available for consideration.

I hope this clarifies any questions you had regarding your application. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further queries.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator for the UCL Software Engineering MSc program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about applying to the Computer Science undergraduate program at UCL. We're delighted to hear that you're interested in joining our community of scholars!

Regarding your first question, if you are studying more than three A levels, we will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. If you are studying more than three A levels, your offer may be based on the three most relevant subjects for your programme. Please note that UCL considers a small number of Foundation programmes, so it's best to contact us directly for further guidance before you apply.

Regarding your second question, you can submit applications for multiple undergraduate programs within UCL. You may submit applications for a maximum of two taught graduate programs for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programs. Please note that if an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

To apply to multiple programs, you can follow these steps:

1. Submit your UCAS application with your top choice program as your first preference.
2. If you are accepted into this program, you will receive a conditional or unconditional offer, depending on the outcome of your A-level results.
3. If you wish to apply to another program within UCL, you can submit an additional UCAS application, listing the new program as your second preference.

Please be aware that each program will take up one of your five UCAS choices and more than one application to the same program or department does not increase your chances of admission. You are welcome to submit more than one application to UCL, however please do consider your options carefully as you have a limited number of choices at UCAS.

We hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout the application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering
