Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your interest in applying to the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). We're delighted to hear that you're considering joining our vibrant community of students and academics.

Regarding your inquiry, I'm happy to clarify the English language proficiency requirements for our graduate programs. According to UCL's policy, all international students must meet one of the university's five levels of English language proficiency or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test. The required evidence should be included with the complete application, but you can submit your application before taking the test.

Please note that if unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.

For more information on UCL's English language policy and the ways in which you can meet the minimum English language requirement for your chosen programme of study, please visit our website or contact us directly.

We look forward to receiving your application and learning more about your qualifications and interests. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering
