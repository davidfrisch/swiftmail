Subject: Re: Undergraduate Programme Application - Queries and Clarifications

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the undergraduate programme in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We're delighted that you're considering joining our community of students.

Regarding your queries, I'd be happy to provide some clarification:

1. Fee status: As an EU citizen, your fee status will be reviewed upon application. This process typically takes around 4-6 weeks from the point of submission. You can expect a decision on your fee status along with your programme offer.
2. Qualifications: Yes, UCL accepts a mix of qualifications in support of your application. If you've completed A-levels and possess equivalent qualifications from another education system (e.g., International Baccalaureate), we'll consider both when reviewing your application. Please ensure that you provide detailed information about all the qualifications you're submitting.
3. Multiple applications: According to our guidelines, applicants can submit applications for a maximum of two undergraduate programmes at UCL for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programmes. If an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

Please note that if you're studying more than three A levels, your offer may be based on the three most relevant subjects for your programme.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the undergraduate programme in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We appreciate your enthusiasm about studying with us.

Regarding your query about fee status, please note that UCL will determine your fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. As an EU citizen, your fee status may be subject to review. Unfortunately, we cannot comment on your fee status until we have received and assessed your application.

However, I can inform you that we aim to provide you with the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this if additional information is required from you to inform our decision. Should further information be required, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Please rest assured that we will communicate our decision on your fee status as soon as we are able to. We appreciate waiting for a university decision can be an anxious time, and we aim to make our decisions by the end of April, but are working hard to send decisions sooner.

Regarding your query about accepting a mix of qualifications, please note that UCL typically prefers applicants to offer qualifications in line with our advertised requirements. However, it may be possible to consider your application with a mix of different qualifications.

For example, we accept a mix of A levels and Cambridge Pre-U or a mix of A levels and Advanced Highers for all programmes. If you are unsure whether your qualifications meet the programme's entry requirements, I recommend contacting us directly so that our admissions team can provide further guidance on how to present your qualifications.

Finally, regarding your query about applying for more than one undergraduate programme at UCL, please note that we allow applicants to submit applications for a maximum of two different programmes for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programmes. Please note that if an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

However, I would like to advise you to carefully consider your options and choices before submitting multiple applications. Each programme will take up one of your five UCAS choices, and more than one application to the same programme or department does not increase your chances of admission.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator for the UCL Software Engineering MSc program
