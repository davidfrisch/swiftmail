Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about your graduate application to the MSc in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, it is not explicitly stated that you need to provide a financial guarantee with your application. However, as an international student, you will be required to demonstrate your ability to fund your studies in the UK. To confirm whether a financial guarantee is required for your application, I would recommend contacting the academic department directly or reaching out to our admissions team at UCL.

Regarding the status of your application, it's stated that we aim to make our decisions by the end of April but are working hard to send decisions sooner. However, as an international student, your fee status assessment may take longer. You will receive a decision on your fee status before making your Firm and Insurance decisions. If additional information is required from you to inform their decision, you will be emailed a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Regarding the next steps that you should take, as an international student, you may need to:

1. Review and understand the conditions of your offer: Make sure you meet or exceed the conditions specified in your conditional offer.
2. Accept your offer by the deadline: If you have not already accepted your offer, do so before the deadline specified in your offer letter.
3. Provide any additional information required: UCL may request additional documents or information to support your application. You will be notified if this is necessary and can upload the required documents securely through Portico (UCL's applicant portal).
4. Confirm your fee status: As an international student, you will need to demonstrate your ability to fund your studies in the UK. UCL will assess your fee status, and you may receive a Fee Status Questionnaire to complete.
5. Register for updates and stay informed: Consider registering interest in your chosen subject to receive notice of graduate open days, events, and more.

I recommend contacting our academic department or admissions team at UCL directly to confirm these next steps and get any specific guidance tailored to your application.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We're happy to help you with your application process.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering
