Subject: Re: Application Enquiry for Computer Science Undergraduate Program at UCL

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We appreciate your enthusiasm and are happy to help you with your application.

Regarding your query about equivalent qualifications, I would like to inform you that we consider a small number of Foundation programmes. However, please note that these programs have specific subject-specific requirements that need to be met. As such, it's essential to review the entry requirements for your desired program and ensure that you meet the necessary criteria.

As per our policy, if an applicant does not meet the minimum academic entry requirement, we consider other factors such as relevant work experience or professional experience (where required by the admitting department). In your case, since you have met the language proficiency requirements, we would need to assess your application based on the information provided in your email and attached transcripts.

To demonstrate that your grades are equivalent to the minimum requirements, please provide us with additional documentation, such as:

1. A detailed explanation of how your previous studies meet the academic requirements for the program.
2. Any relevant work experience or professional experience you may have (if applicable).
3. Any additional information that you think would support your application.

Please note that we will consider all applications holistically, taking into account not only your grades but also any other relevant factors that demonstrate your potential to succeed in our program.

As per our usual practice, I would like to emphasize that entry to the program is very competitive, and the number of applications received exceeds the number of places available. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that you meet all the necessary requirements and provide sufficient supporting information to strengthen your application.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly. I would be happy to provide you with more guidance and support throughout the application process.

Thank you for considering UCL as your institution of choice. We look forward to reviewing your application.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, Software Engineering Program, University College London

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help you with your queries.

According to UCL's graduate FAQs, if you're applying with a degree-level qualification that doesn't meet the minimum entry requirement, you'll need to provide additional information or evidence to demonstrate how your qualifications are equivalent. For undergraduate programs like Computer Science, UCL has specific guidelines for considering equivalent qualifications.

To further demonstrate that your grades are equivalent to the minimum requirements, you might want to consider providing additional evidence, such as:

* A letter from your previous institution or academic advisor confirming that your grades meet the UCL's standards.
* Additional coursework, projects, or certifications that showcase your skills and knowledge in computer science.

Please note that UCL may request more information or evidence if they need further clarification. If you have any questions or concerns, I recommend reaching out to the academic department directly for guidance.
