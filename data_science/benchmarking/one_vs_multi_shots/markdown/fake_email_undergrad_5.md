Subject: Re: Application Query for Computer Science Program - Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for choosing to study at University College London (UCL) for your undergraduate program in Computer Science. I'm David, the program administrator for the UCL Software Engineering MSc program, and I'd be happy to help clarify some of the information regarding your application.

Regarding your first question, your application is currently in a "gathered field". This simply means that we are reviewing your application and determining your fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website.

In terms of when you can expect to receive a decision regarding your fee status, UCL aims to provide you with the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this if additional information is required from you to inform our decision. If further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

As for when you can expect to receive a decision regarding your fee status, UCL aims to make their decisions by the end of April but are working hard to send decisions sooner. Please be assured that we will communicate our decision to you as soon as we are able to.

Lastly, regarding any additional documents or information required to support your application, please rest assured that we will request any missing information required to process your application. We recommend not sending information that has not been requested, and if we require any further documentation, we will contact you by email and ask you to upload them securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal).

Thank you for your patience and understanding during this time. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your application status. I'm happy to help clarify the process for you.

Regarding the "gathered field" notation on your application, it simply means that we are waiting for a sufficient number of applications to be received and assessed before making decisions. This is a standard practice in our department, as it allows us to compare all applications fairly and consistently. Please rest assured that this does not affect the quality or competitiveness of your application.

As for your fee status, I can confirm that we will determine your fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website. We cannot comment on your fee status until we have received and assessed your application. However, if you receive an offer of admission to UCL and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment.

Regarding additional documents or information required for your application, please note that we will only request what is necessary to support your application. If we require any further information, we will contact you by email and ask you to upload it securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal). At this stage, we have not requested any additional materials from you.

I hope this helps alleviate some of the uncertainty surrounding your application. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We appreciate your patience and look forward to being able to inform you of a decision soon.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, Software Engineering Program, UCL
