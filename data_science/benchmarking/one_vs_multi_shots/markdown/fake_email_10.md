Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

Regarding the English language requirements, please refer to our website's Frequently Asked Questions page under "Entry Requirements" [1]. You can also find information on UCL's five levels of English language proficiency and the specific scores required for each level. If you have any further questions or concerns about meeting the minimum English language requirement, feel free to ask.

As for your second question, if your request for accreditation of prior learning is approved, it will not affect the program duration or course load. The accreditation process aims to recognize relevant knowledge and skills gained through work experience, professional certifications, or other non-formal education. If approved, you would be granted credits that can be used towards completing the MSc Software Engineering program.

Please note that this email address [transcripts.pgadmissions@ucl.ac.uk] is only for providing transcripts directly from your University's transcript service. You can upload a word document to your application confirming that you will submit your application through your University's transcript service.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. I'm here to help and look forward to receiving your application soon.

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the Master of Science (MSC) program in Software Engineering at University College London. I'm more than happy to help address your queries.

Regarding your first question, the English language requirements for our graduate programs are outlined on the programme's prospectus page. UCL requires one of its five levels of English language proficiency or specific scores in a UCL-recognised test such as IELTS or TOEFL. To confirm whether you meet the necessary English proficiency standards, please check the programme's prospectus page for the required scores or certifications.

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!

Moving on to your second question, if your request for recognition of prior learning (RPL) is approved, it will reduce the number of credits you are studying at UCL and may impact on your mode of attendance, liability for tuition fees, eligibility for forms of student finance, and the final degree classification you are able to achieve. You should contact our Fees or Funding teams or your student loan provider to confirm what impact gaining accreditation for prior learning could have on your tuition fees, mode of attendance, and student loan eligibility.

Please note that UCL is unable to accept retrospective applications for RPL once you have enrolled on a programme. If you would like to request recognition for prior learning, you must upload a copy of your completed UCL Recognition of Prior Learning Application Form with your UCL application. Your Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) request will be considered alongside your application.

It is essential to consider the potential implications of gaining accreditation for prior learning before making an application. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator for MSc Software Engineering at UCL
