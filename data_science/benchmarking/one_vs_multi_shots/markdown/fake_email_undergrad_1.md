Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your interest in pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We're delighted to hear that you've thoroughly researched our program and are excited about the opportunity to join our academic community.

Regarding financial support, UCL offers a range of scholarships and funding opportunities specifically designed for international students. You can use the UCL Scholarships finder to search for awards that you might be eligible for. Additionally, we offer a limited number of department-specific scholarships for undergraduate students in Computer Science. These scholarships are awarded based on academic merit, and the eligibility criteria typically include being an international student, meeting certain GPA requirements, and demonstrating financial need.

The application deadlines for these scholarships vary depending on the specific award, but most have deadlines in January or February for the following academic year. We will also be sending out information about available scholarships and funding opportunities to all applicants once we receive their applications.

Regarding your application status, I'm pleased to inform you that your application is currently under review by our Admissions Team. We aim to provide a decision on your fee status before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this if additional information is required from you to inform our decision. If further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Please note that you will receive an email from us with the outcome of your fee status assessment once our review is complete. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns about your application or would like more information about scholarships and funding opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.
