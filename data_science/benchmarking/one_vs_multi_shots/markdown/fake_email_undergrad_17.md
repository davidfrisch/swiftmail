Subject: Re: Application Inquiry - Computer Science Undergraduate Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your enthusiasm about studying Computer Science at University College London. I understand your eagerness to know when you can expect to receive a decision on your application.

As mentioned on our website, we use a 'gathered field' approach in assessing applications, which means we need to wait until we have enough comparable applications to make a final decision. Our aim is to make decisions by the end of April, but we're working hard to send decisions sooner.

Please be assured that you'll receive an update on your application as soon as possible. I appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. If there's any additional information required to support your application, our Admissions team will contact you via email and ask you to upload it securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal).

In the meantime, I recommend keeping an eye on your email inbox for updates from our team. You can also register interest in your chosen subject to receive notice of undergraduate open days, events, and more.

Thank you again for your enthusiasm about studying Computer Science at UCL! We'll be in touch soon with an update on your application.

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc program
