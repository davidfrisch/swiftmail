Subject: Re: Questions regarding Undergraduate Application to Computer Science Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your application to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We're happy to help with any questions or concerns you may have.

Regarding your query, we'll consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. If you are studying more than three A levels, your offer may be based on the three most relevant subjects for your programme.

Additionally, regarding your Foundation programme, please note that UCL considers a small number of Foundation programmes. It's best to contact us directly for further guidance before you apply. Please pay particular attention to any subject-specific requirements for your programs of choice as these will still need to be met.

If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help and look forward to reviewing your application soon.

Best regards,
UCL Admissions Team
