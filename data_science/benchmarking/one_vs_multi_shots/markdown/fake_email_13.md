Subject: Re: Application Fee Payment Issue for MSc in Software Engineering Program

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us about the issue with your application fee payment. We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and are here to help.

There can be a number of reasons why your payment is not going through, including:

* The payment system does not accept special characters, please ensure that you only use anglicised characters when making the payment.
* The payment may have been blocked by your card issuer/bank. You should contact them to inform them that you are making an overseas payment.

To resolve this issue, we recommend trying again using a different browser or device. Additionally, you can access Flywire's FAQs, useful videos and articles, and also access the Flywire 24/7 Live Chat and speak with our global support team instantly.

If you continue to experience issues, please feel free to contact us and we will do our best to assist you further.
