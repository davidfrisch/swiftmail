Subject: Re: Query regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Application - Fee Status and Grade Equivalency

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for submitting your application to our BSc in Computer Science programme. We appreciate your patience as we process your application.

Regarding your query about when you can expect to receive a decision regarding your fee status, I'm happy to inform you that we aim to provide the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, if additional information is required from you to inform our decision, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Please note that UCL will determine your fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website. If you receive an offer of admission and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment.

We'll communicate our decision to you as soon as we are able to. Please be assured that we will keep you updated on the progress of your application.

Regarding your query about whether we can consider your application despite the discrepancy in your grades, I regret to inform you that, unfortunately, there is insufficient relevant work experience or professional experience to compensate for not meeting the minimum academic entry requirement. Additionally, the degree-level qualification(s) undertaken by you are below the minimum entry requirement for the programme of study applied for.

I would like to encourage you to contact the academic department directly if you have any further questions or concerns about your application. They may be able to provide you with further feedback and guidance on how to strengthen your application.

Thank you again for considering UCL as your institution of choice. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns about your application for the BSc in Computer Science programme. I'm happy to help address your queries.

Regarding your fee status, we aim to provide an outcome before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, please note that it may take some time to complete our assessment. We will notify you if any additional information is required from you to inform our decision. If further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Regarding your academic qualifications, I understand your concern about the minimum requirements outlined on our website. However, please note that UCL's Admissions Committee assesses each application individually based on various factors, including academic performance, personal statement, and references.

While your grades may not meet the minimum requirements, we appreciate your enthusiasm for the programme and willingness to provide additional information. As part of our review process, we consider all relevant information submitted by applicants. If you would like to provide supporting documents or additional context about your qualifications, please feel free to do so via our online portal.

Please be assured that we will carefully consider your application and assess it against the programme's entry requirements. We aim to make decisions by the end of April but are working hard to send decisions sooner. You can expect to receive an update on your fee status as part of our decision-making process.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help and look forward to discussing your application with you in more detail if needed.
