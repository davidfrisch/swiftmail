Subject: Re: Application Inquiry - MSc in Software Engineering

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London. I'm happy to help answer your questions before proceeding with your application.

To address your first question, it is possible to apply for multiple programs simultaneously as a prospective graduate student. However, please note that you can submit applications for a maximum of two taught graduate programmes for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programs. If an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

You can find this information in the "Applications" section of UCL's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for prospective students applying to graduate taught and research programmes.

Regarding your second question, you are interested in gaining accreditation for prior learning as part of your MSc application. Yes, it is possible to gain accreditation for prior learning at UCL. If you would like to gain accreditation for prior learning, please read through our Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy (UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 1, section 2.8) to check that you are eligible.

Please note that recognition of prior learning will reduce the number of credits you are studying at UCL and therefore this may impact on your mode of attendance, liability for tuition fees, eligibility for forms of student finance and the final degree classification you are able to achieve. Before making an application for RPL, you should contact our Fees or Funding teams or your student loan provider to confirm what impact gaining accreditation for prior learning could have on your tuition fees, mode of attendance and student loan eligibility.

Additionally, please be aware that if your request for recognition for prior learning is approved, you will not be eligible for the Postgraduate Student Loan.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for considering UCL for your graduate studies. I wish you all the best with your applications.

Best regards,

David
