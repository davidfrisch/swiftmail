Subject: Queries regarding Graduate Admissions to MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe and I am writing to express my interest in pursuing the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). Although, unfortunately, my application was unsuccessful, I would like to inquire about a few matters regarding the admissions process.

Firstly, could you please inform me if it is possible to appeal against the decision made on my application? I understand that this may not be an option for everyone, but I am eager to learn from any feedback provided by the university.

Secondly, assuming my application does proceed with a successful outcome in any future appeals or re-evaluations, could you please let me know when I would be able to request a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS)? This information is crucial for my immigration purposes and further planning.

Lastly, if I were to receive an offer this academic year and I wish to defer it to the next academic year, is that possible? If so, could you please provide me with any relevant details or deadlines regarding the deferral process?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions and concerns. I'm happy to help address them.

Regarding your first query, unfortunately, under UCL Admissions policy, reasons for an unsuccessful application are not normally provided for graduate programmes. However, the usual reasons for rejection may include factors such as academic performance, personal statement, or references.

As for appealing against the decision made on your application, I regret to inform you that applications cannot be reconsidered once a decision has been made. You are most welcome to apply for the programme in the following or subsequent years, especially when the intervening time has been spent strengthening your application. However, please note that applications will be considered anew and in competition with all other applications for that particular intake.

Moving on to your second question, if you were to receive an offer this academic year, you would typically have a few weeks to accept it before the deadline. You can then request a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) once you've accepted the offer. This document is essential for your immigration purposes and further planning.

Regarding deferral, I'm afraid that UCL will not accept applications for deferred entry to taught postgraduate programmes. Applicants must apply in the admissions cycle for which they seek entry.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering at UCL
