Subject: Queries regarding UCAS Application for Computer Science Program at UCL

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am an international student applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I have submitted my UCAS application but I still have a few queries regarding the process.

Firstly, I would like to know if it's possible to make changes to the qualifications listed on my UCAS application after submission? I'm concerned that I may need to add or update certain information before the deadline, and I want to ensure that I provide accurate and complete details in my application.

Secondly, I am studying more than 3 A levels (I have 4) as part of my International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum. Could you please advise on how this will be viewed by your admissions team? Will the additional A level being taken affect my chances of getting an offer or will it be considered in a similar way to students taking 3 A levels?

I would appreciate any clarification on these matters, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your queries regarding your UCAS application. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first query, it is not possible to add or update qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission. The information provided must accurately reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking. If there are any changes to your qualifications, please ensure that these are reflected in your IB transcript or other relevant documentation.
