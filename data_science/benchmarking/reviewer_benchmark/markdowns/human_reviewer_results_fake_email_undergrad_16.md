Here's an email from Lewis Smith to UCL Admissions:

Subject: Query regarding Computer Science undergraduate program and Year 0 entry

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in applying for the BSc Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have been fascinated by UCL's strong reputation in computer science and its excellent teaching standards.

Before proceeding with my application, I had a few questions regarding the program structure. Specifically, I was wondering if UCL offers integrated foundation courses, also known as Year 0 entry, for students who do not meet the standard academic requirements for direct entry to the BSc Computer Science program?

I would appreciate it if you could provide me with information on this matter and any other relevant details that might aid in my decision-making process.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to UCL's BSc Computer Science program. I'm happy to help with any questions you may have.

Regarding your query about integrated foundation courses, also known as Year 0 entry, UCL does offer a small number of Engineering Foundation programmes, specifically designed for applicants who do not meet the standard academic requirements for direct entry into our undergraduate engineering degrees, including Computer Science. These programs are aimed at providing a bridging year to help students develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen degree.

Please note that the programme content for the Engineering Foundation Year is the same for all specialisms, therefore multiple applications are not advised. You can find more information about the Engineering Foundation Year on our dedicated webpages.

If you have any further questions or would like to discuss your application, please don't hesitate to contact me directly. I'd be happy to provide guidance and support throughout the process.

Thank you again for considering UCL as a potential destination for your studies. We look forward to receiving your application in due course.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, BSc Computer Science
University College London
