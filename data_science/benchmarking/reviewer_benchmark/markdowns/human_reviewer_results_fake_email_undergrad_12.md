Subject: Undergraduate Programme Application - Queries and Clarifications

Dear UCL Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the undergraduate programme in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I am excited about the opportunity to study at one of the world's leading universities.

However, I do have some questions regarding the application process that I hope you can clarify. Firstly, could you please inform me when I can expect to receive a decision on my fee status? I understand that as an EU citizen, my fee status may be subject to review, and I would like to know approximately how long this process takes.

Secondly, will UCL accept a mix of qualifications in support of my application? As I have completed A-levels, but also possess some equivalent qualifications from another education system (e.g. International Baccalaureate), I am unsure whether these can be combined to meet the programme's entry requirements.

Lastly, is it possible for me to apply for more than one undergraduate programme at UCL? I am interested in exploring other fields within the Computer Science department and would like to know if I can submit multiple applications simultaneously.

Thank you for your time and assistance with my queries. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the undergraduate programme in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We're delighted that you're considering joining our community of students.

Regarding your queries, I'd be happy to provide some clarification:

1. Fee status: As an EU citizen, your fee status will be reviewed upon application. This process typically takes around 4-6 weeks from the point of submission. You can expect a decision on your fee status along with your programme offer.
2. Qualifications: Yes, UCL accepts a mix of qualifications in support of your application. If you've completed A-levels and possess equivalent qualifications from another education system (e.g., International Baccalaureate), we'll consider both when reviewing your application. Please ensure that you provide detailed information about all the qualifications you're submitting.
3. Multiple applications: According to our guidelines, applicants can submit applications for a maximum of two undergraduate programmes at UCL for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programmes. If an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

Please note that if you're studying more than three A levels, your offer may be based on the three most relevant subjects for your programme.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.

Best regards,

David Frischer
