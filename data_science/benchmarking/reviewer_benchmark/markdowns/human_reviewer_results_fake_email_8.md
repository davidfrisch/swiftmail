Subject: Application Inquiry - Graduate Program in Software Engineering (MSc)

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). As a prospective student from [Your Country], I am excited about the opportunity to join UCL's vibrant community and contribute to the field of software engineering.

However, before submitting my application, I would like to inquire about the English language proficiency requirements for the MSc program. Specifically:

Do I need to take a recognized English test (e.g., IELTS or TOEFL) as part of the admission process?

Could you please clarify this requirement and provide any relevant information regarding the English language proficiency standards that UCL expects from international students applying for graduate programs?

I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Thank you for your time, and I wish to express my genuine interest in studying at UCL.

Sincerely,
John Doe

Thank you for reaching out to us about your interest in applying to the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). We're delighted to hear that you're considering joining our vibrant community of students and academics.

Regarding your inquiry, I'm happy to clarify the English language proficiency requirements for our graduate programs. According to UCL's policy, all international students must meet one of the university's five levels of English language proficiency or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test. The required evidence should be included with the complete application, but you can submit your application before taking the test.

Please note that if unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.
