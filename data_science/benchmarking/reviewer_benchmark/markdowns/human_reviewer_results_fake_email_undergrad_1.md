We will also be sending out information about available scholarships and funding opportunities to all applicants once we receive their applications.

Regarding your application status, I'm pleased to inform you that your application is currently under review by our Admissions Team.

However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this if additional information is required from you to inform our decision. If further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Please note that you will receive an email from us with the outcome of your fee status assessment once our review is complete. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns about your application or would like more information about scholarships and funding opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.
