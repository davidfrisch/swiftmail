Subject: Application Questions for Computer Science Undergraduate Program

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am excited to be applying to the Computer Science undergraduate program at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have always been fascinated by UCL's world-class research and academic excellence, and I am eager to contribute to the vibrant community of scholars.

However, I do have some questions regarding my application that I hope you can clarify for me. Firstly, I would like to inquire about how UCL views applications from students who are studying more than three A levels? As I am currently taking four A-levels in Maths, Physics, Computer Science, and Further Mathematics, I wanted to ensure that I meet the requirements.

Additionally, I was wondering if it is possible to apply for multiple undergraduate programs within UCL? As I have a strong interest in computer science, but also have a keen appreciation for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, I would like to explore other related programs as well. If so, what are the procedures and deadlines for doing so?

I look forward to hearing back from you regarding these questions and the rest of my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

Subject: Re: Application Questions for Computer Science Undergraduate Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about applying to the Computer Science undergraduate program at UCL. We're delighted to hear that you're interested in joining our community of scholars!

Regarding your first question, if you are studying more than three A levels, we will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. If you are studying more than three A levels, your offer may be based on the three most relevant subjects for your programme. Please note that UCL considers a small number of Foundation programmes, so it's best to contact us directly for further guidance before you apply.

Regarding your second question, you can submit applications for multiple undergraduate programs within UCL. You may submit applications for a maximum of two taught graduate programs for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programs. Please note that if an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

To apply to multiple programs, you can follow these steps:

1. Submit your UCAS application with your top choice program as your first preference.
2. If you are accepted into this program, you will receive a conditional or unconditional offer, depending on the outcome of your A-level results.
3. If you wish to apply to another program within UCL, you can submit an additional UCAS application, listing the new program as your second preference.

Please be aware that each program will take up one of your five UCAS choices and more than one application to the same program or department does not increase your chances of admission. You are welcome to submit more than one application to UCL, however please do consider your options carefully as you have a limited number of choices at UCAS.

We hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout the application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering
