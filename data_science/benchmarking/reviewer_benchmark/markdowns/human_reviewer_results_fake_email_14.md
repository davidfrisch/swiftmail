Subject: Query regarding Admitted Offer and Programme Details - MSc in Software Engineering

Dear UCL Admissions Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I was recently offered a place on the MSc Software Engineering programme at University College London (UCL). I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for accepting me into this esteemed institution.

However, I am writing to inquire about the next steps regarding my admission. Specifically, if I have accepted my offer but can no longer attend due to unforeseen circumstances, what should I do?

Could you please guide me on how to formally withdraw from the programme and the potential implications on any financial commitments or scholarships that may be involved? If there are any specific procedures or documentation required in this situation, kindly inform me so that I can take the necessary steps.

I would appreciate your prompt response regarding this matter. Your guidance will help me navigate this process with minimal disruption.

Thank you for your time and assistance in advance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for expressing your gratitude for being accepted into our MSc Software Engineering programme. We are delighted that you have chosen UCL as your academic destination.

Regarding your query about withdrawing from the programme, I would like to inform you that unfortunately, applications cannot be reconsidered once a decision has been made. However, if unforeseen circumstances arise and you can no longer attend the programme, please note that we will not accept applications for deferred entry to taught postgraduate programmes. Applicants must apply in the admissions cycle for which they seek entry.

If you decide to withdraw from the programme, please submit your request to our Admissions Team as soon as possible. We will guide you through the process and provide information on any financial commitments or scholarships that may be involved.

To formally withdraw from the programme, you will need to complete a withdrawal form, which can be found on our website. You will also need to provide supporting documentation for your request, such as a letter explaining the circumstances of your withdrawal.

Please note that if you have accepted an offer and subsequently withdraw, you may lose any financial commitments or scholarships that were awarded to you. It is essential to review the terms and conditions of these awards before making a decision.

I hope this information helps you navigate the process. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our Admissions Team. We are here to support you throughout your academic journey at UCL.
