Subject: Query regarding Graduate Programme Admissions and Visa Process

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Master of Science (MSc) programme in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have already secured a place to live in London and am eager to start the programme.

However, as I begin the visa application process for the UK, I wanted to inquire about potential delays that may occur. If my visa is delayed, would this impact my ability to start the MSc programme at UCL? Are there any measures or contingency plans in place to accommodate students whose visas are experiencing processing delays?

Could you please provide me with more information on how UCL handles such situations and what steps I can take to ensure a smooth transition into the programme if my visa application is delayed?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

John Doe

At UCL, we have a dedicated team that handles student visas and works closely with our Admissions team to ensure a smooth transition into the programme.

In cases where a student's visa is delayed, we will work with you to find alternative solutions to minimize any disruption to your studies. This may include:

* Providing additional guidance on the visa application process and what documents are required
* Offering support in terms of accommodation or travel arrangements if needed
