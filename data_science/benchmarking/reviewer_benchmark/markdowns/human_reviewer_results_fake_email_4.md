Subject: Request for Clarification on Conditional Offer Requirements

Dear UCL Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe and I am an international student who has been offered a conditional place in the MSc Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). I am writing to seek your guidance on a few points related to my application.

As per our previous correspondence, I have received a conditional offer subject to meeting certain requirements. However, I would like to clarify one point regarding the financial guarantee. As an international student, is it necessary for me to provide a financial guarantee with my application? If so, what are the specific details and documents required to satisfy this condition?

Additionally, I am concerned about the scenario where there might be delays in obtaining a visa. In such cases, will the UCL Admissions Team be able to accommodate any temporary arrangements or provide extensions on the tuition fee payment deadline? I understand that this is an exceptional circumstance, but I would appreciate it if you could provide some guidance on how these situations are typically handled.

Please let me know the best course of action and any supporting documentation required to confirm my place in the program. Your prompt response will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions regarding your conditional offer. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding the financial guarantee, yes, as an international student, you will need to provide a financial guarantee to support your application. This is a standard requirement for all international students applying to UCL. The financial guarantee should be in the form of a bank statement or a letter from your sponsor (if you're being sponsored) that shows you have sufficient funds to cover your tuition fees and living expenses during your studies at UCL. Please note that we require a minimum of £10,000 per year for tuition fees and £12,000 per year for living expenses.

As for the scenario where there might be delays in obtaining a visa, we understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. In such cases, we will work with you to accommodate any temporary arrangements or provide extensions on the tuition fee payment deadline. However, please note that this is subject to certain conditions and approval from our finance department.

To confirm your place in the program, please upload the required financial guarantee documents to Portico (our applicant portal) as soon as possible. You can find more information about the financial guarantee requirements and supporting documentation on our website under the "Student Fee Status" section.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you throughout your application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
