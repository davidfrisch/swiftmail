Subject: Query regarding Graduate Program Application - Software Engineering MSc

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe and I recently applied for the Master of Science in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). Unfortunately, my application was unsuccessful.

I would like to inquire about the possibility of appealing the decision made regarding my application. Could you please provide me with information on the appeal process, including any relevant deadlines or requirements that need to be met?

Additionally, as an international student planning to pursue the MSc program at UCL, I am interested in learning more about my work options during my studies. Can I work part-time or full-time while attending classes, and if so, are there any specific regulations or restrictions I should be aware of?

I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed response to these questions.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

John Doe

Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for your email and for reaching out to us with your questions about appealing the decision made on your application to our Master of Science in Software Engineering program.

Regarding the appeal process, I regret to inform you that UCL Admissions policy does not provide reasons for an unsuccessful application for graduate programmes. However, as per our policy, if no decision is available on your applicant portal, it means that we are still considering it and have not yet made a decision.

As for working part-time or full-time while attending classes, please note that UCL has restrictions on the number of hours international students can work. According to UKVI regulations, international students are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week during term time, but this is subject to change. It's essential to check with your student visa sponsor for any specific rules or restrictions.

I would like to inform you that our academic department may be able to provide you with further feedback on your application. If you would like to request feedback from us, please contact the Software Engineering program directly.

Please note that application fees are non-refundable, and we do not offer refunds for unsuccessful applications.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm more than happy to assist you.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, Master of Science in Software Engineering, UCL
