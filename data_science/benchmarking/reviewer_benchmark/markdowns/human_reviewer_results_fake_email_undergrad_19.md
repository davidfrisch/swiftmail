Subject: Application Inquiry for Undergraduate Computer Science Program

Dear UCL Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith, and I am an international student from [Country] who is interested in applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL).

Before submitting my application, I would like to inquire about a few details regarding the admissions process.

Firstly, I was wondering if UCL accepts Extra or Late applications for this program? I had initially planned to submit my application by the deadline but was unable to complete it in time. I am eager to apply and would appreciate any guidance on whether I can still be considered.

Secondly, I wanted to confirm if there are any additional documents or information that I need to provide to support my application? Are there any specific requirements for international students like myself?

I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide regarding these queries. If there's anything else I need to do or prepare before submitting my application, please let me know.

Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

Subject: Re: Application Inquiry for Undergraduate Computer Science Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at UCL. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, we typically only accept a small number of Extra or Late applications for our programs. These are clearly indicated on the UCAS website. If UCAS shows the message "This course is not accepting applications at this time. Please contact the provider to find out more," unfortunately, we will not consider any late or extra applications for that particular program.

However, I can check if there's still availability in our program. Could you please let me know your predicted grades and any relevant information about your academic background? This will help me assess whether we might be able to accommodate a Late application.

As for your second question, UCL will request any missing information required to support an application. Please do not send any additional documents or information that has not been requested by us. If we require any additional documents to process your application, we'll contact you via email and ask you to upload them securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal).

For international students like yourself, please note that UCL will request specific information from you during the application process. This includes, but is not limited to, proof of qualifications, English language proficiency test results (if applicable), and any other relevant documentation.

Before submitting your application, I recommend reviewing our After You Apply guide on the UCAS website for more information about the required documents and procedures.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through the application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
