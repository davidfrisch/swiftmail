Subject: Application Fee Payment Issue for Graduate Program in Software Engineering

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to seek your assistance regarding a technical issue I am experiencing with paying the application fee for my graduate program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL).

My name is John Doe and I have submitted an online application for the MSc program. However, when attempting to pay the Â£90 application fee using my credit card, I encountered an error message indicating that the payment was not going through. Despite multiple attempts, I am unable to complete the payment process.

Could you please advise me on what steps I can take to resolve this issue? Is there an alternative method of payment that I can use, or would it be possible for me to pay by other means (e.g. bank transfer)?

I have already submitted my online application and I am eager to proceed with the rest of the admissions process. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Thank you for your prompt assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us about the issue you're experiencing with paying the application fee for our MSc program in Software Engineering. I'm David Frischer, the program administrator, and I'll be happy to assist you in resolving this matter.

I've checked on your application, and it appears that you have successfully submitted your online application. However, I understand that the payment process is not going through. In cases like this, we recommend trying a different payment method or contacting Flywire, our payment processor, for assistance.

As an alternative, you can also try using a different credit card or contact your bank to see if there are any issues with your account. If you're still experiencing difficulties, please let me know and I'll be happy to provide further guidance.

Additionally, if you'd like to pay by bank transfer, we can provide you with our bank details. Please note that this option may take a few days to process, so it's essential to ensure the payment is made successfully before proceeding.

Once the application fee payment is processed, your application will be considered complete, and we'll review it accordingly.
