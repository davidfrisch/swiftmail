I am an international student, can I work during my studies?
-----------------------------
In most cases, international students will hold a Student visa which will allow you to work in the UK during your studies. Please check your visa to confirm your permitted working hours.

Please note that if you are a part-time student, then you will not be permitted to work in the UK during your studies. If you are a student visitor, then you will not be permitted to work in the UK during your studies.

For more information about the working restrictions for international students, please contact the UCL Student Immigration Advice Team.
