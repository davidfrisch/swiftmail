I want to gain accreditation for prior learning, can I do this?
-----------------------------
If you would like to gain accreditation for prior learning, please read through our Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy (UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 1, section 2.8) to check that you are eligible.

There are rules governing the maximum number of credits that can be recognised and these regulations differ depending upon the type of programme you are studying. Additionally, UCL can only accept requests to gain accreditation for prior learning where the learning has been completed within the last five calendar years before the start of your programme. Applications for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) may only be made prior to the point of admission.

UCL is unable to accept retrospective applications for RPL once you have enrolled on a programme. If you would like to request recognition for prior learning, you must upload a copy of your completed UCL Recognition of Prior Learning Application Form with your UCL application. Your Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) request will be considered alongside your application.

If you receive an offer, your offer letter will include the details of any approved Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Please note that all Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) requests are considered at UCL's discretion.
