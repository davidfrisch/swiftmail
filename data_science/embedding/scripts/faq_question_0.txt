How many graduate programmes can I apply for?
-----------------------------
You may submit applications for a maximum of two taught graduate programmes for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programmes. Please note that if an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.

Specific advice about applying to some departments is outlined below:

If you are considering applying to the LLM within the Faculty of Laws, you should apply for either the general LLM or one LLM specialism route. You are not permitted to apply for both. If you want to study an LLM with a specialism, you should apply to the relevant LLM specialism route. If you are unsure at this stage whether you want to specialise or would like to study a general LLM, then you should apply to the general LLM route.

UCL does not accept multiple applications for the same programme in the same academic year.
