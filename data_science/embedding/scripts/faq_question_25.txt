I need a Student visa, when should I apply?
-----------------------------
You can apply for your Student visa as soon as you receive your Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS). The earliest you can apply is six months before the start of your programme.

You can find out more about applying for a visa from outside the UK, including current visa processing times, on the UK Government website.
