Why is my application fee payment not going through?
-----------------------------
There can be a number of reasons why your payment is not going through:

Please do not use a Firefox browser to make your payment.
The payment system does not accept special characters, please ensure that you only use anglicised characters when making the payment.
The payment may have been blocked by your card issuer/bank. You should contact them to inform them that you are making an overseas payment.
