Dear [Advisor’s Name],

My name is [Student Name], and I am a prospective student who has applied for the MSc Software Systems Engineering programme. I received and accepted the conditional offer and am waiting for my final year transcript. My student number is [Student Number].

I have some questions regarding the study and accommodations.

1. On the website, it mentions that students undertake modules to the value of 180 credits; however, the listed compulsory modules add up to 210 credits. Does this mean I will have a choice between MSc Software Systems Engineering Research Project and MSc Software Systems Engineering Group Project? Additionally, how many optional modules will I be able to choose?
2. I am currently applying for UCL postgraduate accommodation and meet all the criteria for prioritised accommodation:
- You are an international, first-year postgraduate student studying for one of the following qualifications: a full-time Master’s programme, Postgraduate Diploma, or a MPhil/PhD.
- You have firmly accepted an offer to study at UCL, conditional or unconditional, by 30 June 2023
- You have not previously lived in London whilst studying at a Higher Education Institution (University)
- You apply for single person accommodation
- You do not hold UK fee status You submit your application by the deadline – that’s 30 June 2023

After I hopefully become a UCL student and receive postgraduate accommodation offer, will I be able to pay for the accommodation on a monthly basis as an international student?

1. As an international student, how will the tuition fee payment be divided across the academic year? If applicable, what are the deadlines?

Thanks in advance, Sincerely, [Prospective Student]
