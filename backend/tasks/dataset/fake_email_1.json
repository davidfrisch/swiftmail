  "email": "Subject: Application Questions for MSc in Software Engineering at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am a prospective student from [Country] interested in applying for the Master's degree program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL).\n\nI was hoping to clarify a few essential details before submitting my application. Could you please kindly assist me with the following questions?\n\n1. As an international student, do I need to take a recognized English language proficiency test (e.g., IELTS or TOEFL) prior to applying for the MSc program in Software Engineering? If so, are there any specific scores required?\n2. Can international students like myself work part-time during their studies at UCL? Are there any restrictions or guidelines that I should be aware of regarding employment during my graduate program?\n\nLastly,\n\n3. Do I need to pay an application fee for each master's degree program that I apply to, including the MSc in Software Engineering? If so, what is the amount of the application fee and are there any exemptions available?\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with the necessary information regarding these questions.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Please feel free to contact me at [john.doe@email.com](mailto:john.doe@email.com) or +[phone number] if you require any additional details.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",

      "answer": "The required evidence should, if possible, be included with the complete application. However, you can submit your application before you have taken a test. If either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.",
