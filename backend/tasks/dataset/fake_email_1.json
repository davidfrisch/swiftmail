  "email": "Subject: Query regarding updating contact information for Graduate Application\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am an international student applying to the MSc Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). I submitted my online application through your portal on [date].\n\nAs I am going through the application process, I realized that I need to update my contact information. Specifically, I would like to change my email address associated with my graduate application.\n\nCould you please guide me on how to make this change? Is there a specific section within the application portal where I can update my email address or any other contact details?\n\nI understand that this may seem like a minor issue, but I want to ensure that all future communication from UCL reaches me correctly. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIf you require any additional information or documentation to facilitate the change, please let me know. I am more than happy to provide it.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
