  "email": "Subject: Reference Request and Expiration Query for Graduate Program in Software Engineering\n\nDear Admissions Team at UCL,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek your assistance with two queries regarding my application to the graduate program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL).\n\nAs an international student, I am excited about the opportunity to join your esteemed institution and pursue my academic and professional goals. However, I have encountered a couple of issues that I would appreciate your guidance on.\n\nFirstly, I noticed that my referee has not received any reference request from UCL. As per our communication, they are expecting an email invitation to submit their reference letter. Could you please look into this matter and ensure that the referee receives the necessary information? If there is a specific deadline for submitting references, could you kindly inform me of it?\n\nSecondly, my reference portal link has expired. I was wondering if there's a way to revive or extend the expiration date, as one of my referees has not had the opportunity to submit their letter yet. Alternatively, would it be possible to provide an updated link or instructions on how to upload the reference? I would appreciate any guidance you can offer in this regard.\n\nI am confident that your assistance will resolve these issues and enable me to complete my application successfully. If there's any additional information required from my end, please do let me know.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
