My name is John Doe, and I am applying for the Master's program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL) for the upcoming academic year. As a local student, I am excited about the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at UCL.\n\nI was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance on the decision timeline for my application. I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know when I can expect to receive a decision regarding my application. Specifically, I would like to know:\n\n* What is the typical timeframe for reviewing and making decisions on graduate applications?\n* Are there any specific deadlines or milestones that I should be aware of in terms of receiving a decision?\n\nI understand that admissions processes can be complex and time-consuming, but any information you can provide regarding the timeline would be greatly appreciated. It will help me plan my next steps accordingly.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
