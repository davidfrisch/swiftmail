  "email": "Subject: Questions regarding MSc Software Engineering Application\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about two matters related to my application for the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL).\n\nFirstly, I have attached a transcript from my undergraduate studies with my online application. However, it appears that my university only provides official transcripts directly to the institution I am applying to. As such, they will not be able to send me a copy of my transcript for me to upload or provide to UCL manually.\n\nCould you please let me know if there are any alternative arrangements that can be made in this situation? Are there any specific instructions or forms that I need to complete to facilitate the official transcript being sent directly from my university to UCL?\n\nSecondly, I am reaching out to inquire about the procedures for withdrawing my application and accepting a different offer of admission. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I can no longer attend the MSc program at UCL.\n\nCould you please provide me with information on how to formally withdraw my application and inform the university that I will be declining the offer? Additionally, would it be possible for you to confirm in writing whether any administrative fees may still be applicable despite withdrawing my application?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance with these matters. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
