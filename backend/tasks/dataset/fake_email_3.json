  "email": "Subject: Queries regarding Graduate Application to Software Engineering Program at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am an international student applying for the Master's program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I am excited about the opportunity to be part of your esteemed institution and would like to clarify some details regarding my application.\n\nFirstly, I would like to know how to provide details of my referees. Should I enter their names and contact information on the online application form? Or is there a separate section for referee details?\n\nSecondly, do I need to take a recognised English test before applying for my graduate programme? If so, which tests are accepted by UCL, and what are the minimum scores required?\n\nThirdly, if my referee is unable to upload their reference letter, what alternative options do they have? Can they provide a hard copy of the reference or email it directly to you?\n\nFourthly, can you please inform me when I can expect to receive a decision on my graduate application? Is there a specific timeline for processing applications and making offers?\n\nLastly, am I required to provide references with my application? Should I request them from my referees before submitting my application, or will they be contacted separately by the admissions team?\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could clarify these points for me. I am looking forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Doe",
