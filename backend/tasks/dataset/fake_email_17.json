{"email": "Subject: Query regarding Graduate Programme Admissions and Visa Process\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in the Master of Science (MSc) programme in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have already secured a place to live in London and am eager to start the programme.\n\nHowever, as I begin the visa application process for the UK, I wanted to inquire about potential delays that may occur. If my visa is delayed, would this impact my ability to start the MSc programme at UCL? Are there any measures or contingency plans in place to accommodate students whose visas are experiencing processing delays?\n\nCould you please provide me with more information on how UCL handles such situations and what steps I can take to ensure a smooth transition into the programme if my visa application is delayed?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe", "questions": [{"question": "What happens if my visa is delayed?", "answer": "If your visa is delayed and you are unable to arrive at UCL by the start date stated in your offer letter you may be able to start your programme late, but this will depend on the programme and how late you expect to arrive.\n\nIf your programme is able to accommodate a late start and your late arrival is approved by your department, please ensure that you arrive at UCL as soon as possible after your original start date. If your programme is unable to accommodate a late start, you may need to defer your place.\n\nPlease contact your department to discuss your options if you believe that your visa will be delayed.", "category": "International students"}], "prompt": "\n      Your name is John Doe and you are applying for a graduate program in Software Engineering. \n      You are a local student that is interested in the MSc program at UCL.\n      \n      Write an email to UCL admissions asking the following questions:\n \n      What happens if my visa is delayed?\n      \n    "}
