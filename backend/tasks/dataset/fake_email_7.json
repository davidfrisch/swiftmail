  "email": "Subject: Inquiry about Graduate Program Application and Admissions Process\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am an international student applying to the Master's program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I have been thoroughly researching the program and am excited about the opportunity to join your esteemed institution.\n\nAs I prepare my application, I had a few questions regarding the process. Firstly, I would like to inquire about the possibility of obtaining a graduate application fee waiver. As an international student, I believe this would be a significant help in simplifying the application process.\n\nSecondly, I initially applied for the [initial program name] programme but have since realized that I am more interested in pursuing the Master's program in Software Engineering. Could you please guide me on how to change my programme preference? I understand that this may require additional information or documentation from my side.\n\nLastly, I would appreciate clarification on the deadline for providing references. I want to ensure that I submit all necessary documents well within time and avoid any potential delays in the evaluation process.\n\nI would be grateful if you could provide me with a response at your earliest convenience. If there is any additional information or documentation required from my side, please let me know.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
