  "email": "Subject: Questions about Graduate Programme Application\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in applying for the MSc in Software Engineering at UCL. As a local student, I have always been fascinated by the university's excellence in teaching and research.\n\nBefore I submit my application, I would like to clarify two important details. Firstly, do I need to take a recognised English test (such as TOEFL or IELTS) before applying for the graduate programme? I am confident in my language proficiency, but I want to confirm whether this is a requirement for international students.\n\nSecondly, are interviews required as part of the application process for the MSc Software Engineering programme? I would like to know what to expect from the admissions process and if there will be an opportunity to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in person.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Doe",

      "question": "Do I need to take a recognised English test before I apply for my graduate programme?",
      "answer": "The required evidence should, if possible, be included with the complete application. However, you can submit your application before you have taken a test. If either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.",
