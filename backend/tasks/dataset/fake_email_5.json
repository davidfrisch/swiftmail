  "email": "Subject: Inquiry regarding Additional Documents and Application Information for Software Engineering Graduate Program at UCL\n\nDear University College London (UCL) Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am an international student who has submitted my application to the Master's program in Software Engineering at UCL. I am excited about the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at your esteemed institution.\n\nAs I was preparing my application, I encountered a few questions that I hope you can assist me with:\n\n1. How do I upload or replace additional documents after I have submitted my application? I had initially uploaded my transcripts and certificates, but I realized that I needed to provide additional information to support my application. Could you please guide me on the process of uploading these new documents?\n2. How do I change my mode of attendance? I initially intended to study full-time, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I would like to switch to part-time studies. What are the procedures for making this change, and what implications might it have on my application and future enrollment?\n3. My reference portal link has expired. Can you please provide guidance on how I can still obtain a reference from my referee? Should I request an extension or contact the referee directly to provide the necessary information? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n4. How do I replace or amend my referee's contact details? In case my original referee is unavailable or unwilling to provide a reference, what are the procedures for updating their contact information or obtaining a new reference?\n\nI understand that these questions may seem minor, but I am eager to ensure that my application is complete and accurate. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated as it will enable me to submit any necessary updates and confirm my enrollment at UCL.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and consideration. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information or clarification on these matters.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
