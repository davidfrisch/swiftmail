  "email": "Subject: Queries on Application Requirements for Graduate Program in Software Engineering at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am an international student applying for the Master's program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). As I prepare my application, I have a few questions regarding the requirements.\n\nFirstly, I was wondering if I am required to provide references with my application. If so, what is the recommended number of references and are there any specific guidelines for their content?\n\nUnfortunately, my reference portal link has expired. Could you please guide me on how I can obtain or request a new reference from my referees? Are there any specific requirements or deadlines for submitting references?\n\nLastly, if I am unable to nominate academic referees, can I consider nominating professional referees instead? Have you had students in the past who have successfully applied with professional references?\n\nI would appreciate it if you could clarify these points as soon as possible. I am excited about the opportunity to join the UCL community and contribute to the Software Engineering program.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
