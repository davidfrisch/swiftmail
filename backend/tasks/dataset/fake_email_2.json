I am John Doe, an international student applying for the graduate program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I am excited about the prospect of joining your esteemed institution and would like to clarify a few details regarding my application.\n\nFirstly, could you please inform me when I can expect to receive a decision on my graduate application? I understand that processing times may vary, but any guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSecondly, do I need to pay an application fee for the program? If so, what is the payment process and deadline?\n\nRegarding my reference portal link, it has unfortunately expired. Could you please guide me on how I can provide a reference for my application? Would it be possible to extend the reference submission period or would you like me to request a new link from my referee?\n\nLastly, do I need to provide a CV with my application? If so, what are the preferred formats and guidelines for submitting it?\n\nI would appreciate it if you could address these questions at your earliest convenience. Your prompt response will enable me to proceed with my application confidently.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
