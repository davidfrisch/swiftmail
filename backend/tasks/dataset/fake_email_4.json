  "email": "Subject: Request for Clarification on Conditional Offer Requirements\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe and I am an international student who has been offered a conditional place in the MSc Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). I am writing to seek your guidance on a few points related to my application.\n\nAs per our previous correspondence, I have received a conditional offer subject to meeting certain requirements. However, I would like to clarify one point regarding the financial guarantee. As an international student, is it necessary for me to provide a financial guarantee with my application? If so, what are the specific details and documents required to satisfy this condition?\n\nAdditionally, I am concerned about the scenario where there might be delays in obtaining a visa. In such cases, will the UCL Admissions Team be able to accommodate any temporary arrangements or provide extensions on the tuition fee payment deadline? I understand that this is an exceptional circumstance, but I would appreciate it if you could provide some guidance on how these situations are typically handled.\n\nPlease let me know the best course of action and any supporting documentation required to confirm my place in the program. Your prompt response will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Doe",

      "answer": "If your visa is delayed and you are unable to arrive at UCL by the start date stated in your offer letter you may be able to start your programme late, but this will depend on the programme and how late you expect to arrive.\n\nIf your programme is able to accommodate a late start and your late arrival is approved by your department, please ensure that you arrive at UCL as soon as possible after your original start date. If your programme is unable to accommodate a late start, you may need to defer your place.\n\nPlease contact your department to discuss your options if you believe that your visa will be delayed.",
