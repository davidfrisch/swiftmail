  "email": "Subject: Application Fee Payment Issue for MSc in Software Engineering Program\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to bring to your attention a concern I have regarding my application for the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). My name is John Doe, and I am a local student interested in pursuing this graduate program.\n\nDuring the online application process, I attempted to pay the application fee using my preferred payment method. However, the payment did not go through, and I received an error message indicating that there was a problem with the transaction. Despite retrying multiple times, I have been unable to successfully complete the payment.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could provide me with some guidance on how to resolve this issue. Could you please let me know why my application fee payment is not going through? Are there any specific requirements or restrictions that I should be aware of when making the payment?\n\nI am eager to proceed with my application and have attached a copy of my receipt for your reference.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Doe",
