I am John Doe, a local student applying to the Graduate Program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I am excited about the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies with your esteemed institution.\n\nAs part of my application process, I would like to request two pieces of information:\n\n1. Application Fee Payment Receipt: Could you please provide me with a receipt or confirmation that my application fee has been received? I would like to confirm that it was processed successfully.\n2. Updating Referee Contact Information: During the application process, I had listed a referee who unfortunately had some changes in their contact details. Is there a way for me to replace or update their contact information on your end? If so, please let me know the procedure and any necessary documentation required.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could address these queries at your earliest convenience. Your prompt response will enable me to move forward with my application efficiently.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",
