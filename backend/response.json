Subject: Re: Application Questions for MSc in Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in our Master's degree program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help answer your questions before submitting your application.

**1. English Language Proficiency Test:**
Do I need to take a recognised English test before I apply for my graduate programme? The English language requirements for the programme are stated on the programme's prospectus page. You may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency, or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test.

**2. Part-time Employment:**
Can international students like myself work part-time during their studies at UCL? Are there any restrictions or guidelines that I should be aware of regarding employment during my graduate program? Unfortunately, there is no straightforward answer to this question as it depends on various factors such as the nature of your programme and the type of job you're interested in. I would recommend exploring UCL's student employment guidance for more information.

**3. Application Fee:**
Do I need to pay an application fee for each master's degree program that I apply to, including the MSc in Software Engineering? If so, what is the amount of the application fee and are there any exemptions available? Yes, you do need to pay an application fee for each programme you apply to. The **Â£90** application fee applies to each programme.

Please feel free to contact me at david.smith@ucl.ac.uk or +44 (0)20 7679 0123 if you require any additional details.

Thank you again for your interest in our program, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

David
