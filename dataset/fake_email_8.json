  "email": "Subject: Application Inquiry - Graduate Program in Software Engineering (MSc)\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in applying for the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). As a prospective student from [Your Country], I am excited about the opportunity to join UCL's vibrant community and contribute to the field of software engineering.\n\nHowever, before submitting my application, I would like to inquire about the English language proficiency requirements for the MSc program. Specifically:\n\nDo I need to take a recognized English test (e.g., IELTS or TOEFL) as part of the admission process?\n\nCould you please clarify this requirement and provide any relevant information regarding the English language proficiency standards that UCL expects from international students applying for graduate programs?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nThank you for your time, and I wish to express my genuine interest in studying at UCL.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Doe",

      "answer": "The required evidence should, if possible, be included with the complete application. However, you can submit your application before you have taken a test. If either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.",
