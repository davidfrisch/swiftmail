"email": "Dear PG Team, I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Prospective Student], and I am writing to express my interest in the Software Systems Engineering MSc at UCL programme at Imperial for the September 2024 intake. One of my primary motivations for seeking enrollment in this course is to enhance my knowledge and gain access to resources that will enable me to actively contribute to sustainable development in the energy sector in [Country Name] and accelerate the adoption of green energy via low cost technology. I am writing to request a brief call with a member of the department to learn more about the programme, and I am particularly interested in any ongoing research opportunities or projects within the department that align with my goals. I have attached my CV to provide you with additional context about my background and experiences. I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to the possibility of discussing my aspirations and learning more about the exciting opportunities within the department. Sincerely, [Prospective Student]"
