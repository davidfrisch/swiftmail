{"email": "Here is the email:\n\nSubject: Transfer Application and Exceptional Circumstances Query\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am a local student who has been interested in pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). As I am currently studying at another university, I would like to inquire about the process of transferring to UCL.\n\nCould you please provide me with information on how to apply for transfer? I understand that there may be specific requirements and procedures to follow. I would appreciate any guidance on what I need to do next.\n\nAdditionally, my academic grades do not meet the entry requirements specified in the Computer Science program at UCL. However, I believe that my grades are equivalent to those of other students who have been accepted into this program. Would it be possible for you to consider an exception or take into account any mitigating circumstances?\n\nI am confident that I would thrive in your esteemed institution and contribute positively to the academic community. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the transfer application process and any potential exceptions.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "I am currently studying at another university but want to transfer to UCL.
