{"email": "Subject: Queries regarding Undergraduate Admissions in Computer Science at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am Lewis Smith, an international student applying for the BSc in Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). I am excited about the opportunity to study at your esteemed institution and would appreciate it if you could provide me with some information regarding my application.\n\nFirstly, I was wondering when I can expect to receive a decision on my fee status. As an international student, I understand that there may be certain criteria that need to be met before a final determination is made. Could you please let me know the typical timeframe for receiving this information?\n\nSecondly, I had a query about making changes to the qualifications listed on my UCAS application after submission. If I am awarded additional A-levels or other qualifications prior to the start of term, would it be possible for me to update my application? Or is there a specific deadline by which any amendments must be made?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any information you can provide regarding these matters.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance with this inquiry. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "When can I expect to receive a decision on my fee status?", "answer": "UCL aims to provide the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions.
