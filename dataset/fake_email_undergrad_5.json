{"email": "Here's an email to UCL Admissions:\n\nSubject: Application Query for Computer Science Program - Lewis Smith\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am writing regarding my undergraduate application to the Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I am excited about the prospect of studying in one of the world's top institutions for computer science.\n\nI was informed that my application is currently in a \"gathered field\". Could you please clarify what this means? Is it simply a matter of awaiting further review or are there additional steps that need to be completed before my application can proceed?\n\nAdditionally, I would appreciate some guidance on when I can expect to receive a decision regarding my fee status. As a UK student, I believe I am eligible for home fees, but I want to confirm this with your team.\n\nLastly, could you please let me know if there are any additional documents or information that I need to submit in support of my application? Have all relevant materials been received and processed?\n\nI would be grateful if you could provide me with some insight into the current status of my application. Your assistance will help alleviate any uncertainty, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "I've been told my application is in a gathered field, what does this mean?", "answer": "A 'gathered field' approach allows UCL to assess all applications in the same fair and consistent manner, whether they are received in October or January.
