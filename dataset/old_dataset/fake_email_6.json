  "email": "Subject: Application Inquiry - MSc in Software Engineering\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe and I am a prospective international student from [Country] interested in applying for the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London.\n\nBefore proceeding with my application, I have a few questions that I would appreciate your assistance with:\n\n1. **Number of Graduate Programs**: As a prospective graduate student, can I apply for multiple programs simultaneously? If yes, are there any specific procedures or requirements I need to follow?\n\n2. **Accreditation for Prior Learning**: I am a practicing software engineer with several years of experience in the industry. I am interested in gaining accreditation for prior learning as part of my MSc application. Could you please guide me on whether this is possible and if so, what are the specific requirements or documentation needed to facilitate this process?\n\nI would appreciate any guidance or clarification regarding these questions.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance with this inquiry.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Doe",

      "question": "How many graduate programmes can I apply for?",
      "answer": "You may submit applications for a maximum of two taught graduate programmes for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programmes. Please note that if an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.\n\nSpecific advice about applying to some departments is outlined below:\n\nIf you are considering applying to the LLM within the Faculty of Laws, you should apply for either the general LLM or one LLM specialism route. You are not permitted to apply for both. If you want to study an LLM with a specialism, you should apply to the relevant LLM specialism route. If you are unsure at this stage whether you want to specialise or would like to study a general LLM, then you should apply to the general LLM route.\n\nUCL does not accept multiple applications for the same programme in the same academic year.",

      "question": "I want to gain accreditation for prior learning, can I do this?",
      "answer": "If you would like to gain accreditation for prior learning, please read through our Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy (UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 1, section 2.8) to check that you are eligible.\n\nThere are rules governing the maximum number of credits that can be recognised and these regulations differ depending upon the type of programme you are studying. Additionally, UCL can only accept requests to gain accreditation for prior learning where the learning has been completed within the last five calendar years before the start of your programme. Applications for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) may only be made prior to the point of admission.\n\nUCL is unable to accept retrospective applications for RPL once you have enrolled on a programme. If you would like to request recognition for prior learning, you must upload a copy of your completed UCL Recognition of Prior Learning Application Form with your UCL application. Your Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) request will be considered alongside your application.\n\nIf you receive an offer, your offer letter will include the details of any approved Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Please note that all Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) requests are considered at UCL's discretion.",
