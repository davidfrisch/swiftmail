My name is John Doe and I recently applied for the Master of Science in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). Unfortunately, my application was unsuccessful.\n\nI would like to inquire about the possibility of appealing the decision made regarding my application. Could you please provide me with information on the appeal process, including any relevant deadlines or requirements that need to be met?\n\nAdditionally, as an international student planning to pursue the MSc program at UCL, I am interested in learning more about my work options during my studies. Can I work part-time or full-time while attending classes, and if so, are there any specific regulations or restrictions I should be aware of?\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed response to these questions.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Doe",
