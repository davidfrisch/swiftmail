  "email": "Subject: Questions regarding MSc Software Engineering Application\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in applying for the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London. My name is John Doe and I am a local student with a strong passion for software development.\n\nAs I proceed with my application, I have two questions regarding the program:\n\nFirstly, what are the English language requirements for this graduate programme? As I will be studying at UCL, I would like to confirm whether I meet the necessary English proficiency standards. Could you please provide me with information on the required scores or certifications (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL) that I need to submit with my application?\n\nSecondly, if my request for accreditation of prior learning is approved, what impact will this have on my studies at UCL? Specifically, how would this affect my program duration and course load? I would appreciate any guidance you can provide regarding the implications of granting accreditation for prior learning.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe",

      "question": "What are the English language requirements for my graduate programme?",
      "answer": "The English language requirements for a programme are stated on the programme's prospectus page. You may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency, or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test. UCL's English language policy details all of the ways in which you can meet the minimum English language requirement for your chosen programme of study.",

      "question": "If my request to gain accreditation for prior learning is approved, what impact will this have on my studies at UCL?",
      "answer": "If Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is approved this may impact on how your degree classification for your UCL programme of study is calculated. Credits accrued at UCL and awarded via RPL will be counted as part of the qualification requirements and included in the calculation of the degree classification. However, credit awarded by any institution other than UCL will be counted as part of the qualification requirements but will be excluded from the calculation of the classification. Please see Chapter 1, Section 2.8 of the Academic Manual for further details. Additional information on the degree classification rules for postgraduate taught degrees at UCL can be found in Chapter 4, Section 10.6 of the Academic Manual. If you have any questions regarding the impact RPL will have on the classification of your degree please contact your academic department or the Graduate Admissions team.\n\nRecognition of Prior Learning (RPL) will reduce the number of credits you are studying at UCL and therefore this may impact on your mode of attendance, liability for tuition fees, eligibility for forms of student finance and the final degree classification you are able to achieve. Please be aware that if your request for recognition for prior learning is approved you will not be eligible for the Postgraduate Student Loan.\n\nBefore making an application for RPL you should contact our Fees or Funding teams or your student loan provider to confirm what impact gaining accreditation for prior learning could have on your tuition fees, mode of attendance and student loan eligibility.",
