Question: My programme requires a portfolio, how do I submit it?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: Once you have submitted your application it will be reviewed by Admissions selectors who will email you with instructions if they would like to view your portfolio. Please do not upload your portfolio to your application or email it to Admissions.
