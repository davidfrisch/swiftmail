Question: If I have received an offer, can I request to defer it to the next academic year?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: Requests to defer can be considered for the majority of programmes at UCL, with the exception of those offered by UCL Laws, who do not consider deferrals.

Deferral requests must be submitted through the Applicant Portal by 31 August 2024 for September 2024 start dates.

Applications that include any Recognition of Prior Learning cannot be deferred.

If your request is approved you will be sent a new offer letter, which will be conditional upon your application meeting the conditions for the new admissions cycle. If your request is declined, you will need to submit a new application for the next admissions cycle, which will open in October 2024.

Deferral requests will not be processed where you hold an offer that is still conditional and/or where the request is submitted after 31 August 2024.

Deferral requests are considered at UCL's discretion.
