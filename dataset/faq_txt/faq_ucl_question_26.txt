Question: What happens if my visa is delayed?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: If your visa is delayed and you are unable to arrive at UCL by the start date stated in your offer letter you may be able to start your programme late, but this will depend on the programme and how late you expect to arrive.

If your programme is able to accommodate a late start and your late arrival is approved by your department, please ensure that you arrive at UCL as soon as possible after your original start date. If your programme is unable to accommodate a late start, you may need to defer your place.

Please contact your department to discuss your options if you believe that your visa will be delayed.
