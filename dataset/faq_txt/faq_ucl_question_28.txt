Question: I'm an international student and have received a conditional offer, should I provide a financial guarantee with my application?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: If you are an international applicant who requires a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS), a financial guarantee should be provided at the point you request your CAS.

The financial guarantee should state that either you or your sponsor is able to cover any outstanding fees and maintenance for the duration of your programme of study.

A financial guarantee should not be provided during the application stage.
