Question: What should I do if I have not yet accepted my offer?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: If you have not yet accepted your offer, please do so as soon as possible through the Applicant Portal.

If you do not accept your offer by the deadline date stated in your offer letter, your offer will be withdrawn and you will not be able to take up your place.

UCL does not automatically acknowledge your acceptance of an offer. You will be able to view your acceptance in the Applicant Portal. Once you have accepted your offer, we will communicate with you directly via the Applicant Portal to confirm your next steps and to confirm when pre-enrolment opens.
