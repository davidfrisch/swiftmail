Question: When can I request a CAS?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: In most cases, your Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) will be automatically assigned to you three to four months before the start of your programme. You will receive an email confirmation once this is available. Once you have accepted your offer and all conditions have been met, if your CAS is not assigned automatically you will be prompted to make a request through the UCL Portal.
