{"email": "Subject: Application Questions for Computer Science Undergraduate Program\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am excited to be applying to the Computer Science undergraduate program at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have always been fascinated by UCL's world-class research and academic excellence, and I am eager to contribute to the vibrant community of scholars.\n\nHowever, I do have some questions regarding my application that I hope you can clarify for me. Firstly, I would like to inquire about how UCL views applications from students who are studying more than three A levels? As I am currently taking four A-levels in Maths, Physics, Computer Science, and Further Mathematics, I wanted to ensure that I meet the requirements.\n\nAdditionally, I was wondering if it is possible to apply for multiple undergraduate programs within UCL? As I have a strong interest in computer science, but also have a keen appreciation for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, I would like to explore other related programs as well. If so, what are the procedures and deadlines for doing so?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you regarding these questions and the rest of my application.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "I am studying more than 3 A levels, how will you view my application?", "answer": "UCL will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects.

Multiple applications to the same programme or department do not increase your chances of admission.
