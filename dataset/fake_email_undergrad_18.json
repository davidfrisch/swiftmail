{"email": "Here is the email:\n\nSubject: Query regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Application - Fee Status and Grade Equivalency\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to inquire about the status of my application for the BSc in Computer Science programme, which I submitted on [date]. My name is Lewis Smith and I am a local student from London.\n\nFirstly, could you please let me know when I can expect to receive a decision regarding my fee status? I understand that this process may take some time, but I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an estimated timeline for the review of my application in this regard.\n\nSecondly, I wanted to address a concern I have regarding my academic qualifications. While my grades do not meet the minimum requirements for admission as outlined on your website, I believe they are equivalent in terms of academic rigor and content. Would it be possible for you to consider my application despite this discrepancy? I would like to provide additional information or supporting documents to demonstrate how my qualifications align with those required by UCL.\n\nI am eager to hear back from you regarding these queries and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "When can I expect to receive a decision on my fee status?", "answer": "UCL aims to provide the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions.
