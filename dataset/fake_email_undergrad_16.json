  "email": "Here's an email from Lewis Smith to UCL Admissions:\n\nSubject: Query regarding Computer Science undergraduate program and Year 0 entry\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in applying for the BSc Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have been fascinated by UCL's strong reputation in computer science and its excellent teaching standards.\n\nBefore proceeding with my application, I had a few questions regarding the program structure. Specifically, I was wondering if UCL offers integrated foundation courses, also known as Year 0 entry, for students who do not meet the standard academic requirements for direct entry to the BSc Computer Science program?\n\nI would appreciate it if you could provide me with information on this matter and any other relevant details that might aid in my decision-making process.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\nLewis Smith",

      "question": "Does UCL offer integrated foundation courses (Year 0 entry)?",
      "answer": "UCL offers a small number of integrated Engineering Foundation programmes, aimed at UK state school students who aspire to become engineers but do not meet the standard entry requirements for UCL's undergraduate engineering degrees. The programme content is the same for all specialisms, so multiple applications are not advised. The UCL Centre for Language and International Education also offers an Undergraduate Preparatory Certificate (International Foundation) for international students.",
