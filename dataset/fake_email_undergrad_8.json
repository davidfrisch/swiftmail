  "email": "Here's an email from Lewis Smith to the University College London (UCL) Admissions team:\n\nSubject: Queries regarding Undergraduate Application\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am reaching out with a few questions regarding my application for the undergraduate program in Computer Science at UCL.\n\nFirstly, I was informed that my application is currently in a \"gathered field\" status. Could you please provide me with an explanation of what this means? Is it still being processed or are there any additional documents required from me?\n\nSecondly, I am interested to know if it is possible to apply for more than one undergraduate program at UCL. If so, could you guide me through the process and provide information on any potential implications?\n\nLastly, I am currently studying at another university but wish to transfer to UCL's Computer Science program. What are the necessary steps I need to take to initiate a transfer? Are there any specific requirements or deadlines that I should be aware of?\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could address these questions and provide me with any relevant information regarding my application status.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith",

    {
      "question": "I've been told my application is in a gathered field, what does this mean?",
      "answer": "A 'gathered field' approach allows UCL to assess all applications in the same fair and consistent manner, whether they are received in October or January. This means UCL will wait until they have enough comparable applications to make a final decision.",
      "category": "After you have applied"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I apply for more than one undergraduate programme?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can submit more than one application to UCL, but each programme will take up one of your five UCAS choices. Multiple applications to the same programme or department do not increase your chances of admission. Most programmes at UCL do not accept an additional personal statement.",

    {
      "question": "I am currently studying at another university but want to transfer to UCL. How do I apply?",
      "answer": "UCL considers transfers into the second year of an undergraduate programme for a limited number of programmes. Entry into year 3 is not considered. Applications should be made via UCAS by the UCAS equal consideration deadline and include a reference from your current institution. Applicants must meet UCL's first-year entrance requirements as detailed in the prospectus.",
