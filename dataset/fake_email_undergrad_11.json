{"email": "Subject: Questions regarding Undergraduate Admissions in Computer Science at UCL\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith, and I am a prospective student applying for the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). As a local student with a strong interest in pursuing a degree in this field, I am excited about the prospect of joining the UCL community.\n\nI wanted to reach out to you regarding some queries I have concerning my eligibility and application process. \n\nFirstly, despite not meeting the minimum grade requirements as specified on your website, I hold grades that are equivalent in value (as per NARIC's guidelines). Could you please let me know if this would be considered during the evaluation of my application?\n\nSecondly, I am a mature student looking to make a career change. Would the university consider applications from mature students who do not meet the typical entry requirements but have relevant work experience and skills in computer science?\n\nLastly, I was wondering if it's possible to apply for more than one undergraduate program simultaneously? If so, are there any additional procedures or requirements I need to be aware of while making multiple applications?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide on these matters. Your time and assistance mean a lot to me, and I am looking forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "My grades don't meet the requirements, but they are equivalent. Would you consider me?", "answer": "UCL typically requires applicants to meet the full requirements. Acceptance of equivalent grades depends on the competition for places. For example, if a programme requires AAA at A-Level, UCL may not accept A*AB. Applicants are recommended to apply to programmes where they meet the requirements.", "category": "Before you apply"}, {"question": "Do you consider applications from mature students?", "answer": "Yes, UCL welcomes applications from mature students. If you are a mature student and have questions about your eligibility, you are encouraged to read the guidance for mature students before applying.", "category": "Before you apply"}, {"question": "Can I apply for more than one undergraduate programme?", "answer": "Yes, you can submit more than one application to UCL, but each programme will take up one of your five UCAS choices. Multiple applications to the same programme or department do not increase your chances of admission. Most programmes at UCL do not accept an additional personal statement.", "category": "Before you apply"}], "prompt": "\n      Your name is Lewis Smith and you are applying for a undergraduate program in Computer Science at UCL.\n      You are a local student that is interested in the program.\n      \n      Write an email to UCL admissions asking the following questions:\n \n      My grades don't meet the requirements, but they are equivalent.
