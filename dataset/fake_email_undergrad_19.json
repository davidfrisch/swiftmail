  "email": "Subject: Application Inquiry for Undergraduate Computer Science Program\n\nDear UCL Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith, and I am an international student from [Country] who is interested in applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL).\n\nBefore submitting my application, I would like to inquire about a few details regarding the admissions process.\n\nFirstly, I was wondering if UCL accepts Extra or Late applications for this program? I had initially planned to submit my application by the deadline but was unable to complete it in time. I am eager to apply and would appreciate any guidance on whether I can still be considered.\n\nSecondly, I wanted to confirm if there are any additional documents or information that I need to provide to support my application? Are there any specific requirements for international students like myself?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any information you can provide regarding these queries. If there's anything else I need to do or prepare before submitting my application, please let me know.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith",

      "question": "Does UCL accept Extra or Late applications?",
      "answer": "Typically, UCL only has a small number of programmes open to Late or Extra applications. These are clearly indicated on the UCAS website. If UCAS shows the message 'This course is not accepting applications at this time. Please contact the provider to find out more.', UCL will not consider any late or extra applications for that programme. UCL encourages early applications, ideally by the UCAS Equal Consideration Deadline of 31 January 2024. Where late applications are considered, this will be shown on the UCAS website.",
