{"email": "Subject: Queries regarding UCAS Application for Computer Science Program at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am an international student applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I have submitted my UCAS application but I still have a few queries regarding the process.\n\nFirstly, I would like to know if it's possible to make changes to the qualifications listed on my UCAS application after submission? I'm concerned that I may need to add or update certain information before the deadline, and I want to ensure that I provide accurate and complete details in my application.\n\nSecondly, I am studying more than 3 A levels (I have 4) as part of my International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum. Could you please advise on how this will be viewed by your admissions team? Will the additional A level being taken affect my chances of getting an offer or will it be considered in a similar way to students taking 3 A levels?\n\nI would appreciate any clarification on these matters, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "Can I make changes to the qualifications on my UCAS application after submission?", "answer": "UCL may not accept qualifications added to your UCAS application form after submission, and they may not be accepted for meeting offer conditions.
