{"email": "Subject: Queries regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Programme Application\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith, and I am an international student interested in applying for the undergraduate programme in Computer Science at University College London (UCL).\n\nAs I am currently resitting my examinations, I had a few questions regarding the application process.\n\n1. **Re-sit policy**: I am scheduled to retake some of my A-levels/exams and will have the results after the standard deadline for applications has passed. Can I still apply for an undergraduate programme at UCL? If so, would it be possible to receive a conditional offer based on my pending exam results?\n\n2. **Contextual offers**: I understand that you consider contextual factors when making offers to students from underrepresented backgrounds. Does UCL make contextual offers for the Computer Science programme? If yes, can you provide more information about this policy and how it applies to international students like myself?\n\n3. **Mature student applications**: As an adult learner returning to education, I am interested in pursuing a career change into computer science. Do you consider applications from mature students, and what additional information or documentation would be required as part of my application?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any guidance on these matters. Your response will help me make informed decisions regarding my application.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "I am resitting my examinations, can I still apply for an undergraduate programme?", "answer": "Resits are generally considered for most UCL programmes.
