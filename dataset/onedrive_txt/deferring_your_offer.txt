Deffering Your Offer
UCL does not accept requests to defer. 

However, we understand that there are sometimes exceptional circumstances that are outside of your control which means that you will not be able to enrol this year. 

If you need to defer for one of the reasons below, we will consider your request. 

We will consider a request to defer only in the following circumstances: 

The serious illness of the offer holder or the serious illness of a parent, guardian, partner or child of the offer holder. 

The death of a parent, guardian, partner or child of the offer holder. 

The need to take parental or adoption leave during the next 12 months. 

Where the offer holder is directly and severely affected by a natural or human-made disaster (i.e., war, earthquakes or flooding). 

The offer holder has been awarded a UCL scholarship (including UCL partnership agreements and Faculty awards); or a full scholarship (tuition fee and maintenance support) from a recognised funding body - for study in the following academic year. (A ‘scholarship’ does not include student loans. The UCL Student Funding office can confirm the standing of a funding body or partnership as required).
