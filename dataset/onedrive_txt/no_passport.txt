Q: I don't have a passport when I apply 

That’s okay if you don’t have a passport when you first apply. The application form will ask you to upload a copy of your passport but you can upload a blank Word/PDF document instead. 

If you do receive an offer for the programme, you will need to provide passport details later. UCL will need passport details in the summer to issue a CAS for your visa application, so we will ask for it around June or July at the earliest.
