Part-Time/Spring Intake and Contact Hours


At present, we do not offer any of our postgraduate taught programmes as part-time, or via distance learning, or run Spring intakes. All programmes start in September and are currently full-time and campus-based.  

The contact time for each of your 15 credit taught modules will typically include 22-30 hours of teaching activity (classroom based and/or online) over the term of its delivery, with the balance then comprised of self-directed learning and working on your assessments.  

 

Your research project/dissertation module is 60 credits and will include regular contact with your project supervisor(s), who will guide and support you throughout your project. You will dedicate most of your time on this module to carrying out research in connection with your project and writing up your final report.
