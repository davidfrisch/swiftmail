Application Status

We aim to send you a decision within 8 weeks, however at certain points in the year, the decision may take longer due to the high volume of applications we receive. We are sorry that we cannot confirm when you will receive a decision or expedite the process. Your application is important to us and we very much appreciate your patience whilst we consider each application. 

Please note that we cannot begin to process your application until we have received your two references.  

Once a decision is made, we will update your application portal. You can access the Applicant Portal to check the status of your application. When there is an update to the status of your graduate application, you will receive an email informing you of a change to your status. If your application status on the portal has not changed then your application is still under consideration.
