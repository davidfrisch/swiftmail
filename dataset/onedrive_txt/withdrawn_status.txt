Withdrawn Status

On occasion, students may claim 'Home' status in their application form to pay the appropriate fee rates. However, after an offer has been extended, the Graduate Admissions Office (GAO) will request proof of their settled residence status. Failure to provide such proof by the deadline may result in the rescinding of the offer. 

In other instances, high-performing students with a 1st class degree in Mathematics from top-ranked universities may choose to accept an offer from another institution without properly notifying us about their decision. In such cases, GAO will withdraw their offer.
