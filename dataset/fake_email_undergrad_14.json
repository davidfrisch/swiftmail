{"email": "Here is an email from Lewis Smith to UCL Admissions:\n\nSubject: Application Queries - Computer Science Undergraduate Programme\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in applying for the BSc Computer Science undergraduate programme at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I am eager to pursue this prestigious degree and contribute to the vibrant academic community.\n\nHowever, I have some queries regarding the application process that I would like to clarify before proceeding. Could you please assist me with the following:\n\n1. **Re-taking Examinations**: I will be re-sitting my examinations in the upcoming summer session. Will this impact my eligibility for the undergraduate programme? I understand that UCL considers applications from students who have not completed their A levels or equivalent qualifications, and I would like to know if there are any specific requirements or considerations for students in this situation.\n\n2. **Fee Status Decision**: Could you please inform me when I can expect a decision on my fee status? As a student living within the UK, I am interested to know how soon I will receive confirmation of whether I qualify as a Home or Overseas fee payer.\n\n3. **Multiple A Level Subjects**: I will be studying more than three A levels (in Mathematics, Computer Science, and another subject) as part of my re-sit programme. How will UCL view my application in this context? Will the fact that I am taking additional subjects strengthen or weaken my chances of being considered for a place on the BSc Computer Science programme?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance with these queries. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "I am resitting my examinations, can I still apply for an undergraduate programme?", "answer": "Resits are generally considered for most UCL programmes.
