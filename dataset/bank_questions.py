    "question": "How many graduate programmes can I apply for?",
    "answer": "You may submit applications for a maximum of two taught graduate programmes for entry to the 2024/25 academic year. The applications must be for different programmes. Please note that if an application fee is charged, it will be charged per application.\n\nSpecific advice about applying to some departments is outlined below:\n\nIf you are considering applying to the LLM within the Faculty of Laws, you should apply for either the general LLM or one LLM specialism route. You are not permitted to apply for both. If you want to study an LLM with a specialism, you should apply to the relevant LLM specialism route. If you are unsure at this stage whether you want to specialise or would like to study a general LLM, then you should apply to the general LLM route.\n\nUCL does not accept multiple applications for the same programme in the same academic year.",

    "question": "I want to gain accreditation for prior learning, can I do this?",
    "answer": "If you would like to gain accreditation for prior learning, please read through our Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy (UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 1, section 2.8) to check that you are eligible.\n\nThere are rules governing the maximum number of credits that can be recognised and these regulations differ depending upon the type of programme you are studying. Additionally, UCL can only accept requests to gain accreditation for prior learning where the learning has been completed within the last five calendar years before the start of your programme. Applications for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) may only be made prior to the point of admission.\n\nUCL is unable to accept retrospective applications for RPL once you have enrolled on a programme. If you would like to request recognition for prior learning, you must upload a copy of your completed UCL Recognition of Prior Learning Application Form with your UCL application. Your Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) request will be considered alongside your application.\n\nIf you receive an offer, your offer letter will include the details of any approved Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Please note that all Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) requests are considered at UCL's discretion.",
    "category": "Entry requirements"
  },
  {
    "question": "If my request to gain accreditation for prior learning is approved, what impact will this have on my studies at UCL?",
    "answer": "If Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is approved this may impact on how your degree classification for your UCL programme of study is calculated. Credits accrued at UCL and awarded via RPL will be counted as part of the qualification requirements and included in the calculation of the degree classification. However, credit awarded by any institution other than UCL will be counted as part of the qualification requirements but will be excluded from the calculation of the classification. Please see Chapter 1, Section 2.8 of the Academic Manual for further details. Additional information on the degree classification rules for postgraduate taught degrees at UCL can be found in Chapter 4, Section 10.6 of the Academic Manual. If you have any questions regarding the impact RPL will have on the classification of your degree please contact your academic department or the Graduate Admissions team.\n\nRecognition of Prior Learning (RPL) will reduce the number of credits you are studying at UCL and therefore this may impact on your mode of attendance, liability for tuition fees, eligibility for forms of student finance and the final degree classification you are able to achieve. Please be aware that if your request for recognition for prior learning is approved you will not be eligible for the Postgraduate Student Loan.\n\nBefore making an application for RPL you should contact our Fees or Funding teams or your student loan provider to confirm what impact gaining accreditation for prior learning could have on your tuition fees, mode of attendance and student loan eligibility.",

    "category": "Application fees"

  {
    "question": "Can I apply for a refund of the application fee?",
