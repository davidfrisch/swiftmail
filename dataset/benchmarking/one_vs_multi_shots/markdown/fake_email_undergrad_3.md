Subject: Re: Queries regarding Undergraduate Admissions in Computer Science at UCL

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for choosing University College London (UCL) as your preferred institution. We're happy to help answer any queries or concerns you may have.

Regarding your fee status, we aim to provide you with the outcome of our assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, in some cases it may not be possible to do this if additional information is required from you to inform our decision. If further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

As for the typical timeframe for receiving a decision on your fee status, we aim to process applications as quickly as possible. After you have applied, UCL will request any missing information required to support an application. If we require any additional documents to process your application, we will contact you by email and ask you to upload them securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal).

Regarding making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission, please note that UCL may not accept qualifications added to your UCAS application form after it has been submitted. And as such, they may not be accepted for meeting offer conditions. Qualifications data submitted via UCAS must reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking.

If further information is needed from you, we will request this at a later stage in our decision-making process. If you have any concerns about providing information at that time, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

We aim to make our decisions by the end of April, but are working hard to send decisions sooner. Please keep in mind that it's quite usual for some applicants to hear sooner than others, but this doesn't mean that your application will be unsuccessful if you don't get a quick response from us.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help and look forward to welcoming you to UCL soon!

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator for the UCL Software Engineering MSc program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your queries regarding your application to our BSc in Computer Science program. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your fee status, we understand that as an international student, you would like to know the typical timeframe for receiving a decision on this matter. Please be assured that UCL will determine your fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website. We aim to provide you with the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions.

As for making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission, we appreciate your diligence in seeking to update your application if you are awarded additional A-levels or other qualifications prior to the start of term. However, our policy is that any amendments must be made by the original deadline for submitting applications. We cannot accept updates once the deadline has passed.

If you receive an offer from us and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment. These requests must be in writing through the contact form and should include details of how you meet the criteria for an alternative fee status.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We appreciate your interest in studying computer science at UCL and look forward to communicating our decision to you soon.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, BSc Computer Science
