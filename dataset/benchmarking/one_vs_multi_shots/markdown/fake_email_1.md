Subject: Re: Application Questions for MSc in Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying to our Master's program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify some essential details before you submit your application.

Regarding your first question, the English language requirements for a programme are stated on the programme's prospectus page. You may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency, or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test. UCL's English language policy details all of the ways in which you can meet the minimum English language requirement for your chosen programme of study.

As an international student, you will need to demonstrate that you meet our English language requirements before we can consider your application. Please visit our website for more information on how to meet these requirements.

Regarding your second question, part-time work is permitted during studies at UCL, but there are some guidelines and restrictions you should be aware of. The UCL Student Union provides guidance on employment opportunities and any relevant regulations. You may also want to consult the UK's immigration rules regarding working hours for international students.

Lastly, regarding your third question, you will need to submit a separate application for each master's degree program that you apply to, including our MSc in Software Engineering. Each application will require an application fee, which is currently £50 (approximately $65 USD). There are no exemptions available; however, if you're applying to multiple programs within the same department, you may only need to pay one application fee.

I hope this information helps clarify your questions. If you have any further queries or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me at [david.frischer@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:david.frischer@ucl.ac.uk) or +44 (0)20 3108 3801.

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the Master's degree program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify a few essential details before submitting your application.

To answer your first question, as an international student, you do not need to take a recognized English language proficiency test (e.g., IELTS or TOEFL) prior to applying for the MSc program in Software Engineering. According to UCL's prospective students graduate frequently asked questions page, the English language requirements are stated on the programme's prospectus page. You may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency, or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test. I recommend checking the prospectus page for your chosen program to determine the specific English language requirements.

Regarding your second question, international students like yourself can work part-time during their studies at UCL. According to UCL's prospective students graduate frequently asked questions page, you are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during vacations. However, please note that you will need to register with the Student Services Centre and obtain a National Insurance Number before starting any paid employment.

Lastly, regarding your third question, yes, you will need to pay an application fee for each master's degree program that you apply to, including the MSc in Software Engineering. The standard application processing fee is £25 (approximately $33 USD), as stated on UCL's Application Fees page. This fee is payable for each application that requires an application fee.
