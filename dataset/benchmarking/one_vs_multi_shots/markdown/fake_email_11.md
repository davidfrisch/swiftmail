Subject: Re: Questions about Graduate Programme Application

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying for our MSc in Software Engineering programme at UCL. I'm happy to help clarify two important details before you submit your application.

Regarding your first question, you do not necessarily need to take a recognized English test (such as TOEFL or IELTS) before applying. According to our FAQs page, the required evidence should be included with your complete application. You can submit your application before taking the test, and if unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency is provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence.

Regarding your second question, not all programmes at UCL require interviews as part of the selection process. However, it's unclear from our FAQs page which specific programmes do require them. To confirm whether an interview is required for the MSc in Software Engineering programme, I recommend contacting the academic department directly using the contact details on the program's prospectus page.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We look forward to receiving your application and reviewing it carefully.

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator, UCL MSc Software Engineering

Subject: Re: Questions about Graduate Programme Application - MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the MSc in Software Engineering programme at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify two important details before you submit your application.

Regarding your first question, no, you do not need to take a recognised English test (such as TOEFL or IELTS) before applying for the graduate programme. However, please note that if either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.

As for your second question, interviews are not typically required as part of the application process for the MSc Software Engineering programme. However, please note that the English language requirements for a programme are stated on the programme's prospectus page, and you may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test.

I hope this information helps clarify the application process for you. If either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.

Best regards,

David Frischer
