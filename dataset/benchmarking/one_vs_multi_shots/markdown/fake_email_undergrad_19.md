Subject: Re: Application Inquiry for Undergraduate Computer Science Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for your interest in applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We're happy to help with any questions or concerns you may have.

Regarding the admissions process, please note that we recommend only applying to programs where you meet or are expected to achieve the minimum entry requirements. You can find more information about these requirements on our website and in our After you Apply guide.

After submitting your application, UCL will request any missing information required to support it. Please do not send any additional documents or information unless specifically requested by us. If we require any additional documents to process your application, we will contact you via email and ask you to upload them securely through Portico (UCL's applicant portal).

Regarding your question about late applications, typically UCL only has a small number of programs open to Late or Extra applications. These are clearly indicated on the UCAS website. Unfortunately, if UCAS shows the message "This course is not accepting applications at this time. Please contact the provider to find out more.", we will not consider any late or extra applications for this programme.

As an international student, please note that the transcript section of the application form is mandatory. If you would like to send your transcript to us securely through your University’s transcript service, please upload a word document to your application confirming that you will submit your application through your University’s transcript service.

Once you have submitted your application, please have your University's transcript service send your transcript to transcripts.pgadmissions@ucl.ac.uk. Please note that this email address can only be used to provide transcripts directly from your University's transcript service.

If you have any further questions about the admissions process or entry requirements, please don't hesitate to contact Undergraduate Admissions.

Best regards,

Subject: Re: Application Inquiry for Undergraduate Computer Science Program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at UCL. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, we typically only accept a small number of Extra or Late applications for our programs. These are clearly indicated on the UCAS website. If UCAS shows the message "This course is not accepting applications at this time. Please contact the provider to find out more," unfortunately, we will not consider any late or extra applications for that particular program.

However, I can check if there's still availability in our program. Could you please let me know your predicted grades and any relevant information about your academic background? This will help me assess whether we might be able to accommodate a Late application.

As for your second question, UCL will request any missing information required to support an application. Please do not send any additional documents or information that has not been requested by us. If we require any additional documents to process your application, we'll contact you via email and ask you to upload them securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal).

For international students like yourself, please note that UCL will request specific information from you during the application process. This includes, but is not limited to, proof of qualifications, English language proficiency test results (if applicable), and any other relevant documentation.

Before submitting your application, I recommend reviewing our After You Apply guide on the UCAS website for more information about the required documents and procedures.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you through the application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering
