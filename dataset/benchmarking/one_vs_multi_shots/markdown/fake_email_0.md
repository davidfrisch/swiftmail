Subject: Re: Questions regarding MSc Software Engineering Application

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about your MSc Software Engineering application at UCL. I'm happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, we can make alternative arrangements in this situation. You can upload a word document to your application confirming that you will submit your transcript through your University's transcript service. Once you've submitted your application, please have your University's transcript service send your official transcript directly to transcripts.pgadmissions@ucl.ac.uk.

Regarding your second question, if you would like us to remove your details from our systems, you can submit a request to the UCL Data Protection team. This will formally withdraw your application and decline the offer.

As for any administrative fees, please note that application fees are non-refundable. If you decide to withdraw your application, these fees would likely still be applicable.

I hope this helps clarify things for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc program

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions regarding your application to the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). We are happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, we understand that sometimes universities may not provide official transcripts directly to students. In this case, please do not worry about uploading a transcript or sending one manually from your end. As per our instructions on the application form, the transcript section is mandatory, and we will be in touch with you separately to request your official transcript directly from your university.

Please note that once you have submitted your application, you can upload a word document confirming that you will submit your application through your University's transcript service. This will ensure that we receive your official transcript securely.

Moving on to your second question, if you would like to withdraw your application and decline the offer of admission, please let us know as soon as possible. You can do this by sending an email to graduate.admissions@ucl.ac.uk with a clear subject line stating "Withdrawal of MSc Software Engineering Application." In your email, please include your full name, student ID (if you have one), and the reason for withdrawing your application.

Regarding any potential administrative fees, we will review this on a case-by-case basis. Once we receive your withdrawal request, we will confirm whether any fees may still be applicable.

Please note that once your application is withdrawn, it cannot be re-submitted or reinstated.

We appreciate your prompt communication regarding these matters and wish you the best in your future academic pursuits.

Best regards,

David Frischer
