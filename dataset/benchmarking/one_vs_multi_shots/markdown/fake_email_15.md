Subject: Re: Query regarding Graduate Program Application - Software Engineering MSc

Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for your email and for reaching out to us with your questions about appealing the decision made on your application to our Master of Science in Software Engineering program.

Regarding the appeal process, I regret to inform you that UCL Admissions policy does not provide reasons for an unsuccessful application for graduate programmes. However, as per our policy, if no decision is available on your applicant portal, it means that we are still considering it and have not yet made a decision.

As for working part-time or full-time while attending classes, please note that UCL has restrictions on the number of hours international students can work. According to UKVI regulations, international students are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week during term time, but this is subject to change. It's essential to check with your student visa sponsor for any specific rules or restrictions.

I would like to inform you that our academic department may be able to provide you with further feedback on your application. If you would like to request feedback from us, please contact the Software Engineering program directly.

Please note that application fees are non-refundable, and we do not offer refunds for unsuccessful applications.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm more than happy to assist you.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, Master of Science in Software Engineering, UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your application to the Master of Science in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). I'm sorry to hear that your initial application was unsuccessful.

Regarding your questions, I'd be happy to provide you with information on the appeal process and work options during your studies.

Unfortunately, UCL does not offer an appeal process for graduate applications. However, if you would like to request feedback on your application, please note that we do not provide detailed reasons for rejection. The usual reasons for rejection may include:

* The degree-level qualification(s) undertaken by the applicant is/are below, or projected to be below, the minimum entry requirement for the programme of study
* The degree-level qualification(s) undertaken by the applicant is/are not in a relevant subject for the programme of study applied for
* Entry to the programme of study is very competitive and the number of applications received exceeds the number of places available
* There is insufficient relevant work experience to compensate for not meeting the minimum academic entry requirement
* There is insufficient relevant professional experience (where this is required by the admitting department)

If you would like to request feedback, please contact the academic department directly. They may be able to provide you with further information.

Please note that application fees are non-refundable.

Regarding your work options during your studies, as a graduate student at UCL, you will need to balance your studies with other commitments. Please note that as a student, you are expected to commit sufficient time to your studies to achieve academic success. While some part-time work may be acceptable, excessive work hours can impact your ability to complete coursework and assignments on time.

UCL's Student Regulations state that students are not permitted to work more than 10 hours per week during term time, unless otherwise approved by the Student Registry. Additionally, students are expected to maintain a minimum of 15 credits per semester, which may require a certain level of commitment and availability.

It is essential to consider your academic responsibilities when making decisions about part-time or full-time work. We recommend discussing any work arrangements with your department or supervisor before committing to any schedule.

I hope this information helps you plan your studies at UCL. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc
