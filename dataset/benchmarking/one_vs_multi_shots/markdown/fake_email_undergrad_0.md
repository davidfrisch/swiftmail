Subject: Re: Query regarding Fee Status for Undergraduate Application in Computer Science

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your fee status as a prospective undergraduate student applying to our Computer Science program at UCL. I'm happy to help clarify this information for you.

As an international student, you will be considered an International student for tuition fees purposes. This means that you will be charged the international tuition fee rate for your studies at UCL.

Please note that we will not make a definitive assessment of your fee status until we have received and assessed your application. However, based on our current regulations and guidelines, it is likely that you would fall into this category.

For more information about how we determine fee status, I recommend visiting our Student Fee Status webpages or reaching out to the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) for independent guidance.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're always here to help.

Best regards,

David Frischer

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your query regarding your fee status as a prospective undergraduate student applying to the Computer Science program at UCL. I'm happy to help clarify things for you.

According to the information provided by UCL, as a prospective undergraduate student applying to the Computer Science program at UCL, your fee status will be determined in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website.

Further information is also provided by the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA).

Unfortunately, we cannot comment on your fee status until we have received and assessed your application.

If you receive an offer of admission to UCL and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment. These requests must be in writing through the contact form and should include details of how you meet the criteria for an alternative fee status.

Therefore, I am unable to inform you what fee category you will be considered under at this time. However, once your application has been processed and assessed, we will notify you of your fee status as part of our offer letter.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc program
