Subject: Re: Query regarding Computer Science undergraduate program and Year 0 entry

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to UCL's BSc Computer Science program. I'm happy to help with any questions you may have.

Regarding your query about integrated foundation courses, also known as Year 0 entry, UCL does offer a small number of Engineering Foundation programmes, specifically designed for applicants who do not meet the standard academic requirements for direct entry into our undergraduate engineering degrees, including Computer Science. These programs are aimed at providing a bridging year to help students develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen degree.

Please note that the programme content for the Engineering Foundation Year is the same for all specialisms, therefore multiple applications are not advised. You can find more information about the Engineering Foundation Year on our dedicated webpages.

If you have any further questions or would like to discuss your application, please don't hesitate to contact me directly. I'd be happy to provide guidance and support throughout the process.

Thank you again for considering UCL as a potential destination for your studies. We look forward to receiving your application in due course.

Best regards,

David Frischer

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the BSc Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to provide you with information on this matter and any other relevant details that might aid in your decision-making process.

Regarding your question about integrated foundation courses, also known as Year 0 entry, UCL does offer an Engineering Foundation Year for students who do not meet the standard academic requirements for direct entry to our undergraduate programs. This program is designed for applicants who have studied at UK state schools and aspire to become engineers, but do not meet the standard entry requirements.

Please note that this program is aimed specifically at engineering students, so if you're interested in applying to the BSc Computer Science program, you would need to apply directly to that program. However, I can provide you with more information about the Engineering Foundation Year if you'd like to consider it as an option.

In terms of the standard academic requirements for direct entry to the BSc Computer Science program, please refer to our website or contact Undergraduate Admissions (as mentioned in Context 1) for further guidance. They may be able to provide you with more information on this matter.

I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck with your application!

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc program
