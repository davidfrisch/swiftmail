Subject: Re: Application Fee Payment Issue for Graduate Program in Software Engineering

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out about a technical issue you're experiencing while paying the application fee for the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'd be happy to help!

To resolve this issue, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Check if you received an email from UCL within 24 hours of submitting your application, which contains a link to pay the application fee. If you haven't received such an email, please contact Graduate Admissions (as mentioned in Context 0) for further assistance.
2. Ensure that you're using the correct payment method and browser. According to our guidelines, it's recommended not to use Firefox browser to make your payment, and special characters should be avoided when making the payment. You may want to try a different browser or payment method if you encounter issues.
3. If the issue persists, please contact Flywire's support team (as mentioned in Context 3) for assistance with their payment system. They offer a 24/7 Live Chat and global support team that can help resolve any technical issues.

Additionally, it might be helpful to review the Application Fees section on UCL's website (Context 2) to understand the application fee process and any specific requirements or exceptions that may apply to your situation.

Thank you for reaching out about this issue. If you're experiencing difficulties with payment, please feel free to contact Graduate Admissions at UCL using their contact form. They will be able to assist you further and provide guidance on alternative methods of payment or additional information required to process your application. Please include details about the issue you're facing and any relevant screenshots or error messages.

I hope this helps, John, and I wish you the best of luck with your application!

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us about the issue you're experiencing with paying the application fee for our MSc program in Software Engineering. I'm David Frischer, the program administrator, and I'll be happy to assist you in resolving this matter.

I've checked on your application, and it appears that you have successfully submitted your online application. However, I understand that the payment process is not going through. In cases like this, we recommend trying a different payment method or contacting Flywire, our payment processor, for assistance.

As an alternative, you can also try using a different credit card or contact your bank to see if there are any issues with your account. If you're still experiencing difficulties, please let me know and I'll be happy to provide further guidance.

Additionally, if you'd like to pay by bank transfer, we can provide you with our bank details. Please note that this option may take a few days to process, so it's essential to ensure the payment is made successfully before proceeding.

Once the application fee payment is processed, your application will be considered complete, and we'll review it accordingly.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. I'm here to help, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
