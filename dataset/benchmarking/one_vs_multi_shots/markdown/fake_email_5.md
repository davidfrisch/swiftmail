Subject: Re: Query regarding Visa Application for Graduate Program in Software Engineering

Dear John Doe,

Thank you for your email and for considering University College London (UCL) for your MSc program in Software Engineering. As a prospective student, we're happy to help guide you through the necessary steps before joining us.

Regarding your question about the Student visa, I'd like to clarify that most students require a student visa to study at UCL if they are coming to study in the UK for more than 6 months. However, as your program is less than 6 months in duration, you will need to apply for a standard visitor visa.

You can find details on how to apply for a standard visitor visa on our visas and immigration webpages. Please note that you should only apply once you hold an unconditional offer from UCL.

As you're from [Your Country], I recommend checking the UK Government's website for specific requirements and deadlines related to your country of origin. Additionally, you can visit our student visa webpages to get more information on the application process.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout the application process.

Best regards,
David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for choosing to pursue your MSc degree in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to assist with any queries you may have regarding the student visa application process.

As a local student, you will not require a student visa to study at UCL. Since your program is less than 6 months in duration, you can use the standard visitor visa for short periods of study. You can find more information on how to apply for a standard visitor visa on our visas and immigration webpages.

Please note that if you are planning to stay in the UK after completing your studies, you will need to apply for a different type of visa. I recommend checking our student visa webpages for more information on the various visa options available.

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding the student visa application process, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to help and ensure that your transition to UCL is as smooth as possible.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering
