Subject: Re: Queries regarding Graduate Program in Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in the MSc program in Software Engineering offered by University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help answer your queries.

Regarding your first question, a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number can only be requested once you hold an unconditional offer. Therefore, please wait until you receive an unconditional offer from UCL before requesting a CAS number, which is required for visa applications.

Moving on to your second question, if you are offered a place on the program but wish to defer your entry to the next academic year, this possibility is available. To discuss and confirm the possibility, please contact our Graduate Admissions team directly. We will be happy to guide you through the process and provide information regarding any relevant deadlines.

Lastly, as an international student, you would need to apply for a student visa to study at UCL. Regarding part-time employment during your studies, I recommend that you contact the academic department directly for further feedback on any restrictions or limitations.

Thank you again for considering our program. We look forward to hearing back from you soon and hope that we can welcome you to UCL in the near future.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in our MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). We are happy to help clarify any queries you may have.

Regarding your request for a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number, you can request one once you have received an unconditional offer from us. This is usually around 2-3 weeks after submitting your application. Once we make the offer, you will receive instructions on how to access the online system to obtain your CAS number.

As for deferment of entry, it is possible to do so under certain circumstances. If you wish to defer your entry to the next academic year, please contact us as soon as possible after receiving an offer. We will need to discuss the details with you and confirm whether deferment is feasible. Please note that there may be deadlines for deferment applications, so it's essential to get in touch with us promptly.

Regarding part-time employment during your studies at UCL, international students are generally permitted to work up to 20 hours per week during term time. However, please note that you will need to register with the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) and obtain a National Insurance Number before starting any employment. We recommend checking their website for more information on working while studying in the UK.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. We are here to support you throughout your application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
