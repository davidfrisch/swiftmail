Subject: Re: Questions regarding Undergraduate Admissions in Computer Science at UCL

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about applying to our undergraduate program in Computer Science. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your first question, we do consider applications from students who don't meet the minimum grade requirements specified on our website, as long as their qualifications are equivalent in value according to NARIC's guidelines. Our admissions team will assess your application holistically, taking into account not only your academic achievements but also any relevant work experience or skills you may have.

In terms of your second question, we welcome applications from mature students who want to make a career change and pursue a degree in Computer Science. As long as you meet the typical entry requirements for the program (i.e., three A levels), we'll consider your application based on your academic achievements, relevant work experience, and skills in computer science.

Regarding your third question, it is possible to apply for more than one undergraduate program simultaneously, but please be aware that each program will take up one of your five UCAS choices. When making multiple applications, please ensure you carefully consider your options and prioritize the programs that align best with your interests and goals.

To summarize:

* We'll consider your application if you don't meet the minimum grade requirements, as long as your qualifications are equivalent in value according to NARIC's guidelines.
* We welcome applications from mature students who want to make a career change and pursue a degree in Computer Science, as long as they meet the typical entry requirements for the program.
* You can apply for more than one undergraduate program simultaneously, but please be aware that each program will take up one of your five UCAS choices.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help and look forward to receiving your application.

Best regards,

Dear Lewis,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us with your queries about applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I'm more than happy to help answer your questions.

Regarding your first question, you're wondering if being a mature student looking to make a career change would be considered during the evaluation of your application. According to our website's FAQ section, we recommend contacting the Undergraduate Admissions team directly to inquire about how your background as a mature student looking to make a career change would be considered during the evaluation of your application. You can reach them at +44 (0)20 8059 0939 or through their website.

Additionally, you may want to review our entry requirements and competitiveness for undergraduate programs, which might provide some insight into how UCL evaluates applications.

As for your second question, we welcome applications from mature students. The Engineering Foundation Year eligibility section mentions that we consider applications from mature students. Given your background as a mature student looking to make a career change, it seems likely that we would consider your application. However, I always recommend confirming this information directly with the Undergraduate Admissions team or the department of Computer Science at UCL.

Finally, regarding your third question about applying to multiple undergraduate programs simultaneously, our website recommends only applying to programs where you meet or are expected to achieve the minimum academic entry requirement. Since you're a mature student looking to make a career change, you might want to consider applying to multiple programs to increase your chances of getting accepted into one that aligns with your skills and experience.

If you do decide to apply to multiple programs, please be aware that we will request any missing information required to support an application. Make sure you're prepared to provide any additional documents or information as needed. It's also important to note that entry to the program is very competitive, and the number of applications received exceeds the number of places available.

To ensure a smooth application process, I recommend contacting the Undergraduate Admissions team directly to inquire about any additional procedures or requirements for making multiple applications. You can reach them at +44 (0)20 8059 0939 or through their website.

Thank you again for reaching out with your questions. Please don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything else I can help with.
