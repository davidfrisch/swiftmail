Thank you for your email and congratulations again on being offered a place on the MSc Software Engineering programme at UCL!

Regarding your query about formally withdrawing from the programme, please note that UCL has a formal withdrawal process in place. If you are no longer able to attend the programme due to unforeseen circumstances, we recommend that you follow these steps:

1. Contact us: Reach out to our Admissions Team via email (admissions@ucl.ac.uk) or phone (+44(0)20 3108 2222) to notify us of your decision to withdraw.
2. Submit a formal withdrawal request: You will need to submit a written request, stating the reason for your withdrawal and confirming that you wish to formally leave the programme.
3. Complete any outstanding administrative tasks: If there are any outstanding tasks or procedures related to your admission, such as completing online modules or returning equipment, please ensure these are completed before withdrawing.

Regarding potential implications on financial commitments or scholarships, we will work with you to determine the best course of action. Please note that:

* Any tuition fees paid will not be refunded.

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for expressing your gratitude for being accepted into our MSc Software Engineering programme. We are delighted that you have chosen UCL as your academic destination.

Regarding your query about withdrawing from the programme, I would like to inform you that unfortunately, applications cannot be reconsidered once a decision has been made. However, if unforeseen circumstances arise and you can no longer attend the programme, please note that we will not accept applications for deferred entry to taught postgraduate programmes. Applicants must apply in the admissions cycle for which they seek entry.

If you decide to withdraw from the programme, please submit your request to our Admissions Team as soon as possible. We will guide you through the process and provide information on any financial commitments or scholarships that may be involved.

To formally withdraw from the programme, you will need to complete a withdrawal form, which can be found on our website. You will also need to provide supporting documentation for your request, such as a letter explaining the circumstances of your withdrawal.

Please note that if you have accepted an offer and subsequently withdraw, you may lose any financial commitments or scholarships that were awarded to you. It is essential to review the terms and conditions of these awards before making a decision.

I hope this information helps you navigate the process. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our Admissions Team. We are here to support you throughout your academic journey at UCL.

Best regards,
