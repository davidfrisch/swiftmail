Subject: Re: Request for Clarification on Conditional Offer Requirements

Dear John,

Thank you for your email seeking clarification on the conditional offer requirements for the MSc Software Engineering program at UCL. I'm happy to help address your concerns.

Regarding your first question, based on our website's information, there is no specific requirement to provide a financial guarantee with your application. The conditions listed in your initial offer are intended to ensure that you meet the necessary entry requirements and English language proficiency. However, to confirm your place in the program, we may request additional documentation or information from you. I recommend reaching out to our Admissions Team directly to inquire about any specific requirements or documentation needed to satisfy the condition.

You can reach out to us via email at [admissions.team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:admissions.team@ucl.ac.uk) or phone, providing your application number and a brief summary of your situation. They should be able to provide you with more detailed guidance on what's required to confirm your place in the program.

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions regarding your conditional offer. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding the financial guarantee, yes, as an international student, you will need to provide a financial guarantee to support your application. This is a standard requirement for all international students applying to UCL. The financial guarantee should be in the form of a bank statement or a letter from your sponsor (if you're being sponsored) that shows you have sufficient funds to cover your tuition fees and living expenses during your studies at UCL. Please note that we require a minimum of £10,000 per year for tuition fees and £12,000 per year for living expenses.

As for the scenario where there might be delays in obtaining a visa, we understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. In such cases, we will work with you to accommodate any temporary arrangements or provide extensions on the tuition fee payment deadline. However, please note that this is subject to certain conditions and approval from our finance department.

To confirm your place in the program, please upload the required financial guarantee documents to Portico (our applicant portal) as soon as possible. You can find more information about the financial guarantee requirements and supporting documentation on our website under the "Student Fee Status" section.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you throughout your application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering
