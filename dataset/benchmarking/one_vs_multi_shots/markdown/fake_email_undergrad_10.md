Subject: Re: Queries regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Programme Application

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for considering University College London (UCL) as a potential destination for your undergraduate studies. I'm David, the program administrator for the UCL Software Engineering MSc program, and I'd be happy to help address your queries.

Regarding your first question about re-sitting exams, I can confirm that UCL considers resits for most of its undergraduate programmes. As you're an adult learner returning to education, it's likely that your case would be considered. Additionally, it is possible to receive a conditional offer based on your pending exam results.

Secondly, regarding contextual offers, UCL has a scheme called Access UCL that provides lower offers to students from underrepresented groups who meet certain eligibility criteria. While it's unclear whether this scheme applies to international students like yourself, I recommend contacting Undergraduate Admissions or checking the Access UCL scheme webpage for more information.

Finally, as a mature student looking to pursue a career change into computer science, I'm pleased to inform you that UCL welcomes applications from adult learners. You may be required to provide additional information or documentation related to your academic and professional background, as well as any relevant work experience or qualifications.

I hope this helps clarify things for you, Lewis. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help guide you through the application process.

Best regards,

David
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering MSc program

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your questions about applying to our undergraduate programme in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your re-sit policy, we do consider applications from students who are resitting their exams. If you are scheduled to retake some of your A-levels/exams and will have the results after the standard deadline for applications has passed, you can still apply for an undergraduate programme at UCL. We may be able to offer a conditional place based on your pending exam results.

Please note that we require all students to meet our standard entry requirements, including any subject-specific requirements for their chosen programme. If you are resitting exams, please ensure that you provide us with your predicted grades and any relevant documentation from your school or institution. We will assess your application based on the information provided, taking into account your pending exam results.

Regarding contextual offers, yes, UCL does consider contextual factors when making offers to students from underrepresented backgrounds. This includes students who are the first in their family to attend university, those from low-income households, and others who may face barriers to higher education. We also consider international students' circumstances, such as those who have overcome significant challenges or have demonstrated exceptional academic achievements.

For mature student applications, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds, including adult learners returning to education. If you are a mature student, please provide additional information about your background and motivations for pursuing a career change into computer science. We may request additional documentation, such as a personal statement or letters of recommendation, to support your application.

Please feel free to contact us directly if you have any further questions or concerns. We're here to help guide you through the application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, UCL Software Engineering
