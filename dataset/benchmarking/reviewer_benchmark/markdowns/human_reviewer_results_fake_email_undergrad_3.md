Subject: Queries regarding Undergraduate Admissions in Computer Science at UCL

Dear Admissions Team,

I am Lewis Smith, an international student applying for the BSc in Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). I am excited about the opportunity to study at your esteemed institution and would appreciate it if you could provide me with some information regarding my application.

Firstly, I was wondering when I can expect to receive a decision on my fee status. As an international student, I understand that there may be certain criteria that need to be met before a final determination is made. Could you please let me know the typical timeframe for receiving this information?

Secondly, I had a query about making changes to the qualifications listed on my UCAS application after submission. If I am awarded additional A-levels or other qualifications prior to the start of term, would it be possible for me to update my application? Or is there a specific deadline by which any amendments must be made?

I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide regarding these matters.

Thank you for your time and assistance with this inquiry. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your queries regarding your application to our BSc in Computer Science program. We're happy to help clarify any concerns you may have.

Regarding your fee status, we understand that as an international student, you would like to know the typical timeframe for receiving a decision on this matter. Please be assured that UCL will determine your fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website. We aim to provide you with the outcome of your fee status assessment before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions.

As for making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission, we appreciate your diligence in seeking to update your application if you are awarded additional A-levels or other qualifications prior to the start of term. However, our policy is that any amendments must be made by the original deadline for submitting applications. We cannot accept updates once the deadline has passed.

If you receive an offer from us and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment. These requests must be in writing through the contact form and should include details of how you meet the criteria for an alternative fee status.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We appreciate your interest in studying computer science at UCL and look forward to communicating our decision to you soon.

Best regards,

David Frischer
