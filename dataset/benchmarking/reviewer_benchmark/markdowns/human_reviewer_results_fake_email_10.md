Subject: Questions regarding MSc Software Engineering Application

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London. My name is John Doe and I am a local student with a strong passion for software development.

As I proceed with my application, I have two questions regarding the program:

Firstly, what are the English language requirements for this graduate programme? As I will be studying at UCL, I would like to confirm whether I meet the necessary English proficiency standards. Could you please provide me with information on the required scores or certifications (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL) that I need to submit with my application?

Secondly, if my request for accreditation of prior learning is approved, what impact will this have on my studies at UCL? Specifically, how would this affect my program duration and course load? I would appreciate any guidance you can provide regarding the implications of granting accreditation for prior learning.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in the Master of Science (MSc) program in Software Engineering at University College London. I'm happy to help answer your questions.

Regarding the English language requirements, please refer to our website's Frequently Asked Questions page under "Entry Requirements" [1]. You can also find information on UCL's five levels of English language proficiency and the specific scores required for each level. If you have any further questions or concerns about meeting the minimum English language requirement, feel free to ask.

As for your second question, if your request for accreditation of prior learning is approved, it will not affect the program duration or course load. The accreditation process aims to recognize relevant knowledge and skills gained through work experience, professional certifications, or other non-formal education. If approved, you would be granted credits that can be used towards completing the MSc Software Engineering program.
