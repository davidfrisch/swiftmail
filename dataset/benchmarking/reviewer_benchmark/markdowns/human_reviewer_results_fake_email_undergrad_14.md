Subject: Application Queries - Computer Science Undergraduate Programme

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the BSc Computer Science undergraduate programme at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I am eager to pursue this prestigious degree and contribute to the vibrant academic community.

However, I have some queries regarding the application process that I would like to clarify before proceeding. Could you please assist me with the following:

1. **Re-taking Examinations**: I will be re-sitting my examinations in the upcoming summer session. Will this impact my eligibility for the undergraduate programme? I understand that UCL considers applications from students who have not completed their A levels or equivalent qualifications, and I would like to know if there are any specific requirements or considerations for students in this situation.

2. **Fee Status Decision**: Could you please inform me when I can expect a decision on my fee status? As a student living within the UK, I am interested to know how soon I will receive confirmation of whether I qualify as a Home or Overseas fee payer.

3. **Multiple A Level Subjects**: I will be studying more than three A levels (in Mathematics, Computer Science, and another subject) as part of my re-sit programme. How will UCL view my application in this context? Will the fact that I am taking additional subjects strengthen or weaken my chances of being considered for a place on the BSc Computer Science programme?

Thank you for your time and assistance with these queries. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

Subject: Re: Application Queries - Computer Science Undergraduate Programme

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the BSc Computer Science undergraduate programme at University College London (UCL). We're happy to help clarify any questions you may have about the application process.

Regarding your first query, re-taking examinations will not impact your eligibility for the undergraduate programme. UCL considers applications from students who have not completed their A levels or equivalent qualifications, and we welcome applications from students in this situation. Please note that if you are offered a place, your offer will be based on the three highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects.

Regarding your second query, we determine fee status in line with regulations published by the UK government. You can find more information about fee status determination on our website. Unfortunately, we cannot comment on your fee status until we have received and assessed your application. If you receive an offer of admission to UCL and believe that your fee status has been incorrectly assessed, you can request a review of the assessment.

Regarding your third query, if you are studying more than three A levels, including Mathematics and Computer Science, we will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects. Your additional subjects may not necessarily strengthen or weaken your chances of being considered for a place on the BSc Computer Science programme, as our admissions process is competitive and based on various factors.

I hope this information helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're always happy to help.

Best regards,

David Frischer
