Subject: Query regarding Visa Application for Graduate Program in Software Engineering

Dear Admissions Team,

I am John Doe, and I am excited about my application to the MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I have been researching the necessary steps to take before joining the program.

My question is regarding the Student visa. Can you please advise on when I should apply for it? Are there specific deadlines or requirements that I need to meet as an applicant from [Your Country]?

I would appreciate any guidance on this matter to ensure a smooth application process.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for choosing to pursue your MSc degree in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to assist with any queries you may have regarding the student visa application process.

As a local student, you will not require a student visa to study at UCL. Since your program is less than 6 months in duration, you can use the standard visitor visa for short periods of study. You can find more information on how to apply for a standard visitor visa on our visas and immigration webpages.

Please note that if you are planning to stay in the UK after completing your studies, you will need to apply for a different type of visa. I recommend checking our student visa webpages for more information on the various visa options available.

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding the student visa application process, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to help and ensure that your transition to UCL is as smooth as possible.

Best regards,

David Frischer
Program Administrator, MSc Software Engineering
