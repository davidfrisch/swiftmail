Subject: Query regarding Fee Status for Undergraduate Application in Computer Science

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to inquire about my fee status as a prospective undergraduate student applying to the Computer Science program at UCL. My name is Lewis Smith and I am an international student.

Could you please inform me what fee category I will be considered under? I would like to know if I will be classified as a home, EU, or international student for tuition fees purposes.

Thank you for your time in addressing this matter.

Sincerely,
Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your fee status as a prospective undergraduate student applying to our Computer Science program at UCL. I'm happy to help clarify this information for you.

As an international student, you will be considered an International student for tuition fees purposes. This means that you will be charged the international tuition fee rate for your studies at UCL.

Please note that we will not make a definitive assessment of your fee status until we have received and assessed your application. However, based on our current regulations and guidelines, it is likely that you would fall into this category.

For more information about how we determine fee status, I recommend visiting our Student Fee Status webpages or reaching out to the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) for independent guidance.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're always here to help.

Best regards,

David Frischer
