Subject: Query regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Application - Fee Status and Grade Equivalency

Dear UCL Admissions Team,

I am writing to inquire about the status of my application for the BSc in Computer Science programme, which I submitted on [date]. My name is Lewis Smith and I am a local student from London.

Firstly, could you please let me know when I can expect to receive a decision regarding my fee status? I understand that this process may take some time, but I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an estimated timeline for the review of my application in this regard.

Secondly, I wanted to address a concern I have regarding my academic qualifications. While my grades do not meet the minimum requirements for admission as outlined on your website, I believe they are equivalent in terms of academic rigor and content. Would it be possible for you to consider my application despite this discrepancy? I would like to provide additional information or supporting documents to demonstrate how my qualifications align with those required by UCL.

I am eager to hear back from you regarding these queries and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns about your application for the BSc in Computer Science programme. I'm happy to help address your queries.

Regarding your fee status, we aim to provide an outcome before you need to make your Firm and Insurance decisions. However, please note that it may take some time to complete our assessment. We will notify you if any additional information is required from you to inform our decision. If further information is needed, we'll email you a Fee Status Questionnaire for you to complete.

Regarding your academic qualifications, I understand your concern about the minimum requirements outlined on our website. However, please note that UCL's Admissions Committee assesses each application individually based on various factors, including academic performance, personal statement, and references.

While your grades may not meet the minimum requirements, we appreciate your enthusiasm for the programme and willingness to provide additional information. As part of our review process, we consider all relevant information submitted by applicants. If you would like to provide supporting documents or additional context about your qualifications, please feel free to do so via our online portal.

Please be assured that we will carefully consider your application and assess it against the programme's entry requirements. We aim to make decisions by the end of April but are working hard to send decisions sooner. You can expect to receive an update on your fee status as part of our decision-making process.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help and look forward to discussing your application with you in more detail if needed.

Best regards,

David Frischer
