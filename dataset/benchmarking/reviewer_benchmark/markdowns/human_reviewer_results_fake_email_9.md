Subject: Questions regarding Graduate Application to MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am an international student who has recently received a conditional offer to the MSc in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). I am excited about the opportunity to study at UCL and am eager to clarify a few points regarding my application.

As an international student, I was wondering if it is necessary for me to provide a financial guarantee with my application. I understand that this information will be used to assess my ability to fund my studies in the UK. Could you please confirm whether this is required at this stage of the application process?

Regarding the status of my application, could you please inform me when I can expect to receive a final decision? I would like to plan accordingly and make necessary arrangements.

Additionally, if I have not yet accepted my offer by the deadline, what are the next steps that I should take? Should I contact your office directly to confirm my intention to accept the offer or wait for further instructions?

I appreciate your time and assistance with these queries. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Thank you for your help,

John Doe
