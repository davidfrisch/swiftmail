Subject: Re: Application Inquiry - MSc Software Engineering Programme

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the Master of Science (MSc) programme in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). I'm David Frischer, the program administrator for the MSc Software Engineering program.

Regarding your inquiry about the application timeline, please note that our applications are considered on a rolling basis. This means that we review and process applications as they are received, rather than waiting until the deadline. We recommend submitting your application as soon as possible to ensure timely consideration.

As for the deadline, I would advise you to check our programme page for specific details. However, in general, applications can be submitted up to 5pm (UK time) on the advertised deadline date. If you miss the deadline, you will only be able to submit an application for the next admissions cycle, which opens in October [next year].

Regarding your expected decision timeline, we aim to process applications as quickly as possible. However, please note that our degree programmes attract a large number of well-qualified applicants, so it may take some time before we can give you a final decision.

I would like to emphasize the importance of submitting your application early, as courses may suddenly close if filled. We cannot guarantee that applications made after the UCAS Equal Consideration deadline will be given equal consideration.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am more than happy to assist you throughout the application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
MSc Software Engineering Program Administrator
