Subject: Application Inquiry - Computer Science Undergraduate Program

Dear UCL Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London, where I have just submitted my application. As a local student, I am thrilled about the prospect of studying at one of the world's top universities right here in London.

Could you please let me know when I can expect to receive a decision on my application? I understand that admission decisions are typically made by [insert time frame, e.g., March/April], but I was wondering if there were any specific dates or milestones related to Computer Science applications.

I would appreciate any guidance you can provide on the next steps and timeline for my application. Your assistance is greatly appreciated, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

Dear Lewis,

Thank you for your email and for expressing interest in our undergraduate program in Computer Science. We appreciate your enthusiasm for studying at UCL, and we're happy to help with any questions you may have about the application process.

Regarding your query about the timeline for receiving a decision on your application, I can assure you that our admissions team is working hard to review all applications as quickly as possible. As mentioned on our website, it's quite usual for some applicants to hear sooner than others, but this doesn't mean that your application will be unsuccessful if you don't get a quick response from us.

We aim to make our decisions by the end of April, and we're working hard to send decisions sooner. Please be assured that we will communicate our decision to you as soon as we are able to.

In terms of specific dates or milestones related to Computer Science applications, I can inform you that we don't have a fixed timeline for this program. However, rest assured that your application is being processed, and we'll keep you updated on any developments.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're always here to help.

Thank you again for your interest in our Computer Science program at UCL. We look forward to keeping you informed about the status of your application.

Best regards,
