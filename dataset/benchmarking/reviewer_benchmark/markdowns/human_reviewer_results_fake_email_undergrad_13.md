Subject: Queries regarding Undergraduate Computer Science Application

Dear Admissions Team,

My name is Lewis Smith and I am writing to inquire about the application process for the undergraduate Computer Science program at University College London (UCL). As a local student, I am keenly interested in studying at UCL.

I am currently completing a Foundation programme at [Foundation Programme Institution], which will be completed by [Expected Completion Date]. I was wondering if it is possible to apply to the Computer Science program while still on the Foundation programme? Are there any specific requirements or conditions that need to be met before submitting an application?

Additionally, I would like to know if it is feasible to make changes to the qualifications listed on my UCAS application after submission. If so, could you please inform me of the procedure for making these changes and the deadline for doing so?

I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these queries. Thank you for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Lewis Smith

As for making changes to the qualifications listed on your UCAS application after submission, please note that UCL may not accept qualifications added to your UCAS application form after it has been submitted. This includes qualifications submitted either as an amendment or additional qualification. Qualifications data submitted via UCAS must reflect your full academic history and the qualifications you are currently taking.

You can read more about the information required for your application on the UCAS website.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help!
