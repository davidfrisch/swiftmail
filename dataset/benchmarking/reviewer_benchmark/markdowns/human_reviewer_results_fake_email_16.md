Subject: Queries regarding Graduate Program in Software Engineering at UCL

Dear Admissions Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am writing to express my interest in the MSc program in Software Engineering offered by University College London (UCL). As a prospective student from an international background, I have some queries that I would like to clarify before proceeding with the application process.

Firstly, could you please inform me when I can request a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number? I understand that this is required for visa applications and would like to know at what stage I can obtain it.

Additionally, if I have been offered a place on the program but wish to defer my entry to the next academic year, is this possibility available? If so, could you please provide me with further information regarding the process and any relevant deadlines?

Lastly, as an international student, am I permitted to work during my studies at UCL? I would appreciate it if you could confirm whether there are any restrictions or limitations on part-time employment while pursuing my graduate program.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in our MSc program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). We are happy to help clarify any queries you may have.

Regarding your request for a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number, you can request one once you have received an unconditional offer from us. This is usually around 2-3 weeks after submitting your application. Once we make the offer, you will receive instructions on how to access the online system to obtain your CAS number.

As for deferment of entry, it is possible to do so under certain circumstances. If you wish to defer your entry to the next academic year, please contact us as soon as possible after receiving an offer. We will need to discuss the details with you and confirm whether deferment is feasible. Please note that there may be deadlines for deferment applications, so it's essential to get in touch with us promptly.

Regarding part-time employment during your studies at UCL, international students are generally permitted to work up to 20 hours per week during term time. However, please note that you will need to register with the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) and obtain a National Insurance Number before starting any employment. We recommend checking their website for more information on working while studying in the UK.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. We are here to support you throughout your application process.

Best regards,

David Frischer
