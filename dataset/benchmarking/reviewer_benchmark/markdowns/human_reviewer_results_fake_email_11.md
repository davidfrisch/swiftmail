Subject: Questions about Graduate Programme Application

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the MSc in Software Engineering at UCL. As a local student, I have always been fascinated by the university's excellence in teaching and research.

Before I submit my application, I would like to clarify two important details. Firstly, do I need to take a recognised English test (such as TOEFL or IELTS) before applying for the graduate programme? I am confident in my language proficiency, but I want to confirm whether this is a requirement for international students.

Secondly, are interviews required as part of the application process for the MSc Software Engineering programme? I would like to know what to expect from the admissions process and if there will be an opportunity to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in person.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
John Doe

Subject: Re: Questions about Graduate Programme Application - MSc Software Engineering at UCL

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in applying to the MSc in Software Engineering programme at University College London (UCL). I'm happy to help clarify two important details before you submit your application.

Regarding your first question, no, you do not need to take a recognised English test (such as TOEFL or IELTS) before applying for the graduate programme. However, please note that if either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.

As for your second question, interviews are not typically required as part of the application process for the MSc Software Engineering programme. However, please note that the English language requirements for a programme are stated on the programme's prospectus page, and you may be required to meet one of UCL's five levels of English language proficiency or obtain specific scores in a UCL-recognised test.

I hope this information helps clarify the application process for you. If either unsatisfactory or no evidence of English language proficiency has been provided with the application, admission will be conditional upon the provision of such evidence. This condition will be clearly indicated on the offer letter and must be fulfilled before enrolment at UCL.

Best regards,

David Frischer
