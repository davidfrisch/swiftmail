Subject: Application for MSc in Software Engineering - Portfolio Submission Inquiry

Dear Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Master of Science in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). As per the program's requirements, a portfolio is necessary as part of the application process. I would appreciate guidance on how to submit this requirement.

Could you please clarify the format and submission method for the software engineering portfolio? Is it acceptable to submit a link to my personal website or online platform where my work can be viewed, or do you require an attachment in a specific format (e.g., PDF)?

Additionally, if there are any specific guidelines or recommendations on what should be included in the portfolio, I would appreciate any advice.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,
John Doe

Dear John,

Thank you for your interest in the Master of Science in Software Engineering program at University College London (UCL). We appreciate your enthusiasm and are happy to guide you through the portfolio submission process.

For the software engineering portfolio, we recommend submitting a PDF document that showcases your programming skills, projects, and experiences. You can include relevant code snippets, project descriptions, and any other relevant information that demonstrates your abilities in software engineering.

While it is acceptable to submit a link to your personal website or online platform where your work can be viewed, please ensure that the link is publicly accessible and does not require login credentials. If you choose to submit a PDF document, please make sure it is no larger than 5MB.

In terms of what should be included in the portfolio, we suggest highlighting your:

* Programming languages and technologies used
* Project experiences, including roles and responsibilities
* Problem-solving skills and approaches
* Any notable achievements or awards

Please note that the portfolio should not exceed 10 pages (including any appendices). We encourage you to tailor your portfolio to demonstrate how your skills align with the program's curriculum and research areas.

To submit your portfolio, please upload it securely to Portico (UCL's applicant portal) when prompted during the application process. If you have any questions or concerns about the submission process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

We look forward to reviewing your application and portfolio. Good luck with your application!

Best regards,

David Frischer
