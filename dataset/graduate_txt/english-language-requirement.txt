Education which leads to an academic qualification An English language qualification or test result

Education which leads to an academic qualification

This option means you must show us completion of at least 12 months academic education leading to an awarded qualification. This must be in a country that UCL considers to be "majority English-speaking" and the medium instruction must be English. You must receive this qualification no more than two years before the proposed date of enrolment. This includes the summer two years before enrolment if starting in September. Please note that if your studies were completed under transnational education (where the whole duration of the programme was NOT completed in a majority English speaking country), you will be required to take a recognised English test from the list below.

An English language qualification or test result

For this option you must receive the qualification or test result no more than two years before the proposed date of enrolment. For entry in September 2025, this means a test must have been sat on or after September 1st 2023.

Accepted English language qualifications

Listed below are all the English language qualifications and tests that are recognised by UCL.  There are five levels of English proficiency needed to meet UCL’s English language requirements for graduate study:

Level 1 (previously referred to as “Standard level”)

Level 2 (previously referred to as “Good level”) Level 3

Level 4 (previously referred to as “Advanced level”), or Level 5

See each degree programme page to confirm which UCL level of English proficiency you will need to meet. 

We advise that you book a test as early as possible and do not wait until you receive a decision on your application. Test centres are very busy throughout the year and during the summer it may be several weeks before you are able to take a test. We encourage applicants to take a test centre exam if possible, however, we also accept the online exams mentioned in the list below. Please note that regardless of the form of the exam, UCL takes fraud very seriously. If evidence of malpractice is found in a submitted test result, it will result in the submitted application being withdrawn and not being considered further.
