Question: Can I apply for a refund of the application fee?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: Application fees are non-refundable, even if you decide to withdraw from the application process or if you receive an offer and do not take up a place.

In exceptional circumstances, we may agree to refund the application fee if you have made a duplicate payment. Please contact the Graduate Admissions team if you believe that a duplicate payment has been made.
