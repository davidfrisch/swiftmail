Question: My application has been unsuccessful, can I appeal?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: Appeals against unsuccessful decisions can only be made on the grounds of a procedural error. Appeals based on an error of academic judgement will not be considered.

If you feel you have grounds for an appeal, please see our Appeals Procedure.
