Question: Will I need to attend an interview for my graduate programme?
--------------------------------------------------
Answer: A small number of programmes at UCL use interviews as part of the selection process. This will usually be outlined on the programme's prospectus page, however, if you would like to receive confirmation, please contact the academic department directly using the contact details on the programme's prospectus page.
