{"email": "Subject: Queries regarding Graduate Program in Software Engineering at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I am writing to express my interest in the MSc program in Software Engineering offered by University College London (UCL). As a prospective student from an international background, I have some queries that I would like to clarify before proceeding with the application process.\n\nFirstly, could you please inform me when I can request a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number? I understand that this is required for visa applications and would like to know at what stage I can obtain it.\n\nAdditionally, if I have been offered a place on the program but wish to defer my entry to the next academic year, is this possibility available? If so, could you please provide me with further information regarding the process and any relevant deadlines?\n\nLastly, as an international student, am I permitted to work during my studies at UCL? I would appreciate it if you could confirm whether there are any restrictions or limitations on part-time employment while pursuing my graduate program.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohn Doe", "questions": [{"question": "When can I request a CAS?", "answer": "In most cases, your Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) will be automatically assigned to you three to four months before the start of your programme. You will receive an email confirmation once this is available. Once you have accepted your offer and all conditions have been met, if your CAS is not assigned automatically you will be prompted to make a request through the UCL Portal.", "category": "International students"}, {"question": "If I have received an offer, can I request to defer it to the next academic year?", "answer": "Requests to defer can be considered for the majority of programmes at UCL, with the exception of those offered by UCL Laws, who do not consider deferrals.\n\nDeferral requests must be submitted through the Applicant Portal by 31 August 2024 for September 2024 start dates.\n\nApplications that include any Recognition of Prior Learning cannot be deferred.\n\nIf your request is approved you will be sent a new offer letter, which will be conditional upon your application meeting the conditions for the new admissions cycle. If your request is declined, you will need to submit a new application for the next admissions cycle, which will open in October 2024.\n\nDeferral requests will not be processed where you hold an offer that is still conditional and/or where the request is submitted after 31 August 2024.\n\nDeferral requests are considered at UCL's discretion.", "category": "After applying"}, {"question": "I am an international student, can I work during my studies?", "answer": "In most cases, international students will hold a Student visa which will allow you to work in the UK during your studies.
