{"email": "Subject: Questions regarding Undergraduate Application to Computer Science Program\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Lewis Smith and I am excited to be applying for the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). As a local student with a strong interest in computer science, I am eager to join the UCL community.\n\nBefore submitting my application, I had a couple of questions regarding the admissions process that I would like to clarify. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with some guidance on the following:\n\n1. **A Level requirements**: I am aware that your website mentions the requirement for 3 A levels as part of the standard entry criteria. However, I have been studying more than 3 A levels (e.g., in addition to my A levels, I also completed an Extended Project Qualification). How will you view my application if I exceed this threshold? Will it be considered a positive factor or just one of many qualifications taken into account?\n\n2. **Foundation Programme**: As you may know, I am currently completing a Foundation programme at another institution. Can I still apply to the Computer Science program at UCL? Are there any specific requirements or considerations that need to be taken into account when reviewing my application in light of this additional qualification?\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with guidance on these matters so that I can submit a complete and accurate application.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "I am studying more than 3 A levels, how will you view my application?", "answer": "UCL will consider your 3 highest grades, including any required or preferred subjects.
