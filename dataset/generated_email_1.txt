Dear Program Administrator,
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a few questions I have about the graduate program application process.

1. The application deadline has passed. Can I still apply?
2. Can I submit my research application before I have confirmed who will be supervising my research?
3. My university will only provide my transcript directly to UCL. What should I do?
I would appreciate your guidance on these matters to ensure that my application process is smooth and complete. Thank you for your assistance.
Best regards,
Roman
