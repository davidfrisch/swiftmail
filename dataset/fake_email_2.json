  "email": "Subject: Application Fee Payment Issue for Graduate Program in Software Engineering\n\nDear Admissions Team, I am writing to seek your assistance regarding a technical issue I am experiencing with paying the application fee for my graduate program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL). My name is John Doe and I have submitted an online application for the MSc program. However, when attempting to pay the â‚¬390 application fee using my credit card, I encountered an error message indicating that the payment was not going through. Despite multiple attempts, I am unable to complete the payment process. Could you please advise me on what steps I can take to resolve this issue? Is there an alternative method of payment that I can use, or would it be possible for me to pay by other means (e.g. bank transfer)? I have already submitted my online application and I am eager to proceed with the rest of the admissions process. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me. Thank you for your prompt assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon. Sincerely, John Doe",
