  "email": "Subject: Application Fee Payment Issue for Graduate Program in Software Engineering\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to seek your assistance regarding a technical issue I am experiencing with paying the application fee for my graduate program in Software Engineering at University College London (UCL).\n\nMy name is John Doe and I have submitted an online application for the MSc program. However, when attempting to pay the \u00a390 application fee using my credit card, I encountered an error message indicating that the payment was not going through. Despite multiple attempts, I am unable to complete the payment process.\n\nCould you please advise me on what steps I can take to resolve this issue? Is there an alternative method of payment that I can use, or would it be possible for me to pay by other means (e.g. bank transfer)?\n\nI have already submitted my online application and I am eager to proceed with the rest of the admissions process. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.\n\nThank you for your prompt assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Doe",
