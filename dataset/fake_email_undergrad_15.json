{"email": "Subject: Application Enquiry for Computer Science Undergraduate Program at UCL\n\nDear Admissions Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in applying to the undergraduate program in Computer Science at University College London (UCL). I came across your esteemed institution while researching top universities for computer science programs, and I am impressed by the cutting-edge research opportunities and strong industry connections that UCL offers.\n\nAs an international student, I have met the language proficiency requirements but unfortunately, my grades from my previous studies do not meet the minimum requirements specified on the university's website. However, I would like to inquire about the possibility of being considered for admission despite this discrepancy.\n\nCould you please provide me with information regarding your policy on considering equivalent qualifications? Specifically, what documentation or evidence would be required to demonstrate that my grades are equivalent to the minimum requirements? I would appreciate any guidance you can offer in this matter.\n\nI have attached a scanned copy of my official transcripts and a detailed explanation of how my previous studies meet the academic requirements for the program. I believe that my strong academic background, combined with relevant extracurricular activities and a passion for computer science, make me a suitable candidate for consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLewis Smith", "questions": [{"question": "My grades don't meet the requirements, but they are equivalent.
